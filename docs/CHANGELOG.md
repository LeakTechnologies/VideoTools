# VideoTools Changelog

## v0.1.1-dev51 (June 2026)

### GitHub Actions CI — Windows Build Fixed (both platforms green)

- **Windows dev/release CI green for the first time since the GitHub Actions migration** — six root causes fixed across `.github/workflows/dev.yml` and `release.yml`:
  - Build step restored to `shell: msys2 {0}` (Git Bash resolved the wrong gcc from `C:\mingw64` and a Strawberry Perl pkg-config that ignores `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`).
  - `GOROOT` derived inside the MSYS2 shell via `ls -d /c/hostedtoolcache/windows/go/*/x64` (setup-go's env doesn't reach the msys2 shell — previously `go: command not found`).
  - `CC=$(cygpath -m /ucrt64/bin/gcc)` — `setup-msys2` installs to `D:\a\_temp\msys64`, not `C:\msys64`; never hardcode the MSYS2 path.
  - FFmpeg link flags from `pkg-config --libs --static` with a loud `exit 1` on empty output — a silent empty result previously fell back to cgo_preamble.go's local-dev `-LC:/ffmpeg/lib`.
  - `-lsupc++` stripped from pkg-config output; no extra static `-lstdc++` (pkg-config already emits it for FFmpeg 8.1's C++ gfxcapture filter; doubling it caused multiple-definition errors).
  - `-lcrypt32 -lncrypt` added for FFmpeg 8.1 Schannel TLS; `CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW: "-Wl,.*"`.
- **FFmpeg CI cache now saves** — cache only persists on green jobs; subsequent Windows runs skip the ~15-minute FFmpeg source build.

### Windows: Three Static Binaries — DLL/ Folder Retired (settled decision)

- **VideoTools.exe statically links everything** — bz2/z/lzma/iconv/stdc++ static archives promoted into the FFmpeg prefix (first `-L` dir) so ld picks `.a` over MSYS2's `.dll.a`. Fixes the `libbz2-1.dll` / `zlib1.dll` missing-DLL errors on user machines.
- **ffmpeg.exe/ffprobe.exe now built static** — FFmpeg configure gains `--extra-ldflags="-static"` and drops `--disable-programs`; the sidecar binaries are fully self-contained. The shared FFmpeg build and the `DLL/` folder are eliminated from the GitHub CI product.
- **CI gate: objdump dependency check** — all three shipped binaries are scanned for MinGW runtime DLL references (`libbz2`, `zlib1`, `liblzma`, `libiconv`, `libstdc++`, `libwinpthread`, `libgcc`); any hit fails the job so this failure class can never reach a tester again.
- **Windows zip now contains all three binaries** — previous packaging shipped `VideoTools.exe` alone.
- **App bootstrap: static sidecars are the primary state** — new `appcfg.StaticSidecarsWork()`; `AddFFmpegDllsToPath()` no-ops successfully when static sidecars run; `ValidateFFmpegDLLs()` treats the ffprobe smoke test as authoritative and only falls back to per-DLL diagnostics for legacy shared bundles. Startup dialog copy updated.
- **All three Windows pipelines aligned** — `windows-msix.yml` and Forgejo `dev-packages.yml` receive the same surgery: shared FFmpeg build steps deleted, static build gains `-static` extra-ldflags + programs, MSIX layout and `ci-build.ps1` zip bundle static sidecars with per-binary objdump gates (no DLL/ folder). `ci-build.ps1` promotion list extended to lzma/iconv/stdc++ and its DLL import report is now a fatal gate.

### Player Overlay & Cleanup

- **P0: Error/loading/buffering overlay indicators now render** — the four widgets (`loadingSpinner`, `bufferingLabel`, `errorLabel`, `errorIndicator`) were created and hidden/shown by `SetLoading`/`SetBuffering`/`SetError`/`ClearError`, but never added to the renderer's `Objects()` or positioned in `Layout()`. Now render centred over the video with proper z-ordering.
- **Stub method-set divergence fixed** — added 9 missing methods to `inline_player_stub.go`: `SetSeekAccuracy`, `SetAudioDelay`, `SetFilterPipeline`, `GetLastVideoPTS`, `GetLastAudioPTS`, `Enqueue`, `ClearPlaylist`, `PlaylistLen`, `SetPeer`.
- **Dead fields/callbacks removed from VideoPlayer** — `OnFrameRate`, `OnChapterSelect`, `OnHover`, `GetHoverFrame`, `displayFrame`, `displayWidth`, `displayHeight`, `frameSeq`, `lastFrameSeq`, `chapterMark` — all declared but never used or wired.
- **Cosmetic fullscreen/PiP buttons removed** — `toggleFullscreen`/`SetFullscreen`/`IsFullscreen`/`OnFullscreen`/`isFullscreen`/`fullscreenBtn` and `togglePiP`/`IsPiP`/`OnPiP`/`isPiP`/`pipBtn` removed. These flipped booleans and buttons but never entered fullscreen or picture-in-picture.
- **CC button wired to subtitle engine** — `InlineVideoPlayer.NewInlineVideoPlayer()` now wires `OnSubtitles` to call `SelectSubtitleTrack(0)` when enabling subtitles (first available track) or `DisableSubtitles()` when disabling. Previously the CC button just flipped a boolean and logged.
- **Orphaned `internal/media/gpu/` package removed** — 8 Go files, 3 GLSL shaders, zero imports.
- **P1: view.go component split** — 1442-line monolith split into 5 focused files: `view.go` (566, struct/renderer/draw), `split_view.go` (193, independent SplitView widget), `control_overlay.go` (598, transport/OSD/callbacks), `keyboard_shortcuts.go` (50, tap/key handlers), `thumbnail_preview.go` (36, cache). Missing `OnSubtitles()` setter added back.
- **P1: UDF thread safety** — `partitionStartAbs` was read/written without mutex protection in 9 locations (1 write in `findLVD`, 8 reads throughout). Added `partitionStart()`/`setPartitionStart()` mutex-protected helpers; replaced all direct field access. Added `SetProgressCallback()` for per-file extraction progress reporting. `iso_udf.go` now uses `defer reader.Cleanup()` for correct cleanup on all paths.
- **Legacy alias vars removed** — 10 per-module player vars (`convertInlinePlayer`, `trimInlinePlayer`, `inspectInlinePlayer`, `subtitleInlinePlayer`, `upscaleInlinePlayer`, `audioInlinePlayer`, `filtersInlinePlayer`, `filtersPreviewPlayer`, `upscalePreviewPlayer`, `convertPreviewPlayer`) removed from `native_media.go`. All callers already migrated to `GetXxxPlayer()` getters during dev49 consolidation. Legacy getter functions retained as thin wrappers around `GetPrimaryPlayer()`/`GetPreviewPlayer()`.

## v0.1.1-dev50 (June 2026)

### Windows DLL Pipeline Overhaul (BUG-012 + BUG-013 fix)

- **All three CI pipelines now build FFmpeg shared from source** — Forgejo dev-packages.yml, GitHub release.yml, and GitHub windows-msix.yml all build FFmpeg 8.1 from the same source tarball twice: once static (for CGo link into VideoTools.exe) and once shared (for DLLs, ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe). BtbN downloads completely eliminated.
- **GitHub `release.yml` rewritten** — previous workflow used BtbN for the CGo static link (no `.a` libs — linker dead end), only bundled `av*.dll`+`sw*.dll` (missing all transitive deps), and never included `ffmpeg.exe`/`ffprobe.exe`. Now uses source-built FFmpeg 8.1 + x264 + x265 with MSYS2 ucrt64, builds shared FFmpeg from same source, includes objdump transitive-DLL scan.
- **GitHub `windows-msix.yml` rewritten** — same pattern as release.yml. MSIX layout includes `DLL/` with full dep scan.
- **`ExpectedFFmpegDLLs()` updated to glob patterns** — changed from hardcoded ABI versions (`avcodec-61.dll`) to glob patterns (`avcodec-*.dll`). This prevents validation breakage when FFmpeg bumps its ABI version. Added `liblzma-*.dll` for the transitive avformat dependency.
- **`ValidateFFmpegDLLs()` uses glob matching** — validates expected DLLs using `filepath.Glob` instead of exact filename `os.Stat`.
- **BUG-013 closed** — BtbN `latest` moving tag is no longer used. Shared DLLs are built from the same pinned FFmpeg 8.1 source, eliminating ABI drift entirely.
- **`docs/DLL_BOOTSTRAP.md` pipeline docs updated** — architecture diagram and table reflect source-built shared DLLs with no BtbN dependency.

### DLL Startup Validation + CGo Consolidation

- **`ValidateFFmpegDLLs()` in `internal/app/appcfg/ffmpeg_bootstrap.go`** — runs `ffprobe.exe -version` as a live smoke test after adding DLLs to PATH. Checks every expected FFmpeg ABI DLL exists. On failure, displays a non-blocking Fyne error dialog at startup with actionable guidance, rather than a silent log warning that users never see.
- **`--dllcheck` CLI flag** — prints full DLL diagnostics (directory, all files with sizes, expected DLLs, PATH entries, ffprobe presence, smoke test result) and exits. Exit code 1 on validation failure. Designed for tester debugging without needing to launch the GUI.
- **`DiagnoseDLLSetup()` helper** — multi-line diagnostic string covering DLL directory, every file found, expected-but-missing DLLs, PATH entries containing "ffmpeg"/"dll", and bundled executable status.
- **CGo directive consolidation** — all 15 duplicate `#cgo windows CFLAGS/LDFLAGS` blocks removed from `engine.go`, `playback.go`, `hdr.go`, `hwdecode.go`, `subtitle_engine.go`, `subtitle.go`, `audio.go`, `audio_filter.go`, `errors.go`, `scrub.go`, `framepool.go`, `deinterlace.go`, `seh_wrapper.go`, `queue.go`, `thumbnail.go`. Consolidated into a single `internal/media/cgo_preamble.go` with a single set of build directives and a clear comment explaining the CI/local-dev path story.
- **`docs/DLL_BOOTSTRAP.md`** — new documentation covering the full DLL pipeline: why DLLs are needed (shared-linked ffmpeg.exe/ffprobe.exe, not VideoTools.exe itself), DLL/ folder structure, search order, startup validation flow, common issues with fixes, `--dllcheck` usage, and developer setup instructions.

### Collapsible Player Panel (Convert, Filters, Upscale, Inspect, Trim)

- **`BuildCollapsibleHeader` for player panel** in Convert module — `playerHeader` wraps `videoPanel` in a collapsible header bar using `t.ConvertSectionPlayer` (i18n: `"Player"` / `"Lecteur"`). Toggling the header sets `leftColumn.SetOffset(0.5)` when open or `0.03` when collapsed, giving the metadata panel nearly the full vertical height when the player is folded. `videoPanelWithHeader` is a `container.NewBorder` wrapping the canvas; `leftColumn` VSplit updated to use it.
- **`ConvertSectionPlayer string`** i18n key added to `internal/i18n/strings.go` and all four locale files.
- **Filters + Upscale collapsible player** — `BuildCollapsibleHeader(t.ConvertSectionPlayer, …)` wraps the video area in both modules. `resolveOffset()` tracks `playerOpen` + `metaOpen` state: both open → 0.65/0.60; player closed → 0.03; meta closed → 0.97. Metadata toggle callbacks updated to use `resolveOffset` so collapsing the player then re-opening metadata stays consistent. Upscale drops the old `buildUpscaleBox` wrapper for the video section in favour of the collapsible header.
- **Inspect collapsible player** — fixed `GridWithColumns(2)` replaced with `container.NewHSplit` (`mainSplit`). `BuildCollapsibleHeader` wraps the video column; toggle drives `mainSplit.SetOffset(0.5 / 0.03)`, expanding the tabbed Metadata/Chapters/Sync panel when the player is folded.
- **Trim collapsible player** — `leftSide` Border replaced with `container.NewVSplit` (`leftVSplit`): top = `playerHdr + videoContainer` at 65%; bottom = `timeline + toolbar + in/out controls` always visible. Collapsing drives `leftVSplit.SetOffset(0.03)` so the timeline and controls take the full left-panel height.

### Updater — Sidecar File Refresh (DLL + ffmpeg/ffprobe)

- **`updateSidecars(zipPath, exeDir string)`** added to `settings_module.go` — after extracting `VideoTools.exe` from the update zip, iterates all zip entries and extracts: any `DLL/*.dll` file (into `<exeDir>/DLL/`) and `ffmpeg.exe`/`ffprobe.exe` (into `<exeDir>/`). Uses `extractZipEntry(f *zip.File, destPath string)` which renames over the destination atomically. Ensures in-place updates via the built-in updater refresh all side-car binaries so DLL mismatches can't persist across updates.
- **Root cause addressed** — previous updater only extracted `VideoTools.exe`, leaving `ffmpeg.exe`, `ffprobe.exe`, and `DLL/` from the original install permanently stale. Any DLL added after first install (e.g. `liblzma-5.dll`) would only appear on a fresh download, not on an in-place update.

### Logging — Windows Log-Clear Fix + Version Header

- **`logging.Clear()` Windows fix** — `file.Truncate(0)` on a file opened with `O_APPEND` returns "Access is denied" on Windows. Fixed by: closing the append handle → reopening with `O_WRONLY|O_CREATE|O_TRUNC` → writing the cleared-at timestamp + session header → closing → reopening with `O_WRONLY|O_APPEND`. All three steps use the internal `fileMu` lock so no log writes race the truncate.
- **`logging.SetVersion(v string)`** — sets `sessionVersion` package-level var. Called from `main.go` before `logging.Init()`. Version string is embedded into the session header printed at startup and on every `Clear()` call, so logs are always self-identifying even when sent as a fragment.
- **`sessionHeader()` helper** — formats a two-line block: `=== VideoTools <version> session started at <RFC3339> ===` + `Platform: <GOOS>/<GOARCH>`. Used by both `Init()` and `Clear()`.

### CI — Stale DLL Cache Detection

- **`liblzmaPresent` check** in `.forgejo/workflows/dev-packages.yml` — skip-download guard now requires both `avcodec*.dll` AND `liblzma-5.dll`. If the cache directory exists but `liblzma-5.dll` is missing, the script logs `"Stale DLL cache detected"` then wipes `C:\ffmpeg-shared\dll` and `C:\ffmpeg-shared\bin` before re-downloading. Prevents the persistent runner reusing a cache built before `liblzma-5.dll` was a required DLL (introduced transitively by `avformat.dll` in recent BtbN builds).

### UDF Reader — Allocation Descriptor Parsing + Partition Offset

- **`readFIDs` ShortAd parsing** (`internal/dvd/udf/reader.go`) — previously assumed directory data resided at `TagLocation+1`; now parses `ShortAd` allocation descriptors from ICB data, concatenating all extents for multi-extent directories.
- **Partition offset applied universally** — all `LongAd` locations are partition-relative LBNs. `partitionStartAbs` (from `PartitionDescriptor`, default 257) is now added to every ICB read and data seek in `findFSD`, `extractRecursively`, `extractFile`, and `ReadFileData`. Previously LBNs were treated as absolute, causing reads from wrong disc sectors.
- **`extractFile` / `ReadFileData` data source** — file data is now read using allocation descriptors with `InformationLength` from the ICB, not from `icb.Location`/`Len` (which point to the descriptor itself, not the payload). Fixes reading empty or corrupted data for most files extracted from DVD ISOs.

### Playlist / Sequential Playback

- **`InlineVideoPlayer.Enqueue(path string)`** — appends a file path to the internal playlist. When the current item reaches clean end-of-stream, `playbackLoop` auto-advances to the next queued item: loads it (via `loadViaOpen` with `resetPlaylist=false`) then calls `Play()` immediately.
- **`InlineVideoPlayer.ClearPlaylist()`** — empties the queued items without affecting the currently playing item.
- **`InlineVideoPlayer.PlaylistLen() int`** — returns the number of items remaining in the queue (items not yet played).
- **Auto-reset on manual load** — calling `Load`, `LoadDVD`, or `LoadURL` directly resets `playlist` and `playlistIdx` to zero so a new user-initiated load starts fresh, independent of any previously queued items.
- **`InlineVideoPlayer` struct** — added `playlist []string` and `playlistIdx int` (both protected by `mu`).

### HDR Tone-Mapping

- **`internal/media/hdr.go`** — new CGo file (build tag `native_media`) following the `deinterlace.go` pattern. C preamble implements three helpers: `frame_is_hdr` (checks `color_trc` for `AVCOL_TRC_SMPTE2084`/`AVCOL_TRC_ARIB_STD_B67`), `create_hdr_tonemap_filter` (builds libavfilter graph: `buffer → zscale(t=linear,npl=1000) → format(gbrpf32le) → tonemap(hable,desat=0.5) → zscale(t=bt709,m=bt709) → format(yuv420p) → buffersink`), `run_hdr_tonemap` (pushes a frame through and returns an SDR `yuv420p` output). Color metadata (TRC, primaries, matrix, range) is forwarded to the `buffersrc` args so zscale correctly identifies the input transfer characteristic.
- **`Engine` struct fields** — `hdrFilterGraph *C.AVFilterGraph`, `hdrBuffersrc *C.AVFilterContext`, `hdrBuffersink *C.AVFilterContext`, `hdrInputPixFmt C.enum_AVPixelFormat`, `hdrTonemapUnsupported bool`. Graph is created lazily on first HDR frame. `hdrTonemapUnsupported` suppresses retry when zscale (libzimg) is absent, avoiding per-frame graph-creation attempts.
- **`renderSWFrame()` helper in `playback.go`** — centralises the SW→RGBA pipeline: checks `isFrameHDR`→`applyHDRTonemap`→`ensureSwsCtx(tonemapped.format)`→`toRGBA(tonemapped)`, or falls through to `ensureSwsCtx(e.frame.format)`→bwdif deinterlace (if enabled)→`toRGBA`. Replaces four separate inline decode-to-RGBA blocks in `GrabFrame` and `videoDecodeLoop` (SW path and HW→SW-fallback path in each).
- **`freeHDRFilter()` in `Close()`** — releases AVFilterGraph and resets all HDR pointers. Called after `freeDeinterlaceFilter()` in the engine teardown sequence.

### Per-Codec HW Decode Deny-List

- **`media.SetHWCodecDenyList(s string)` / `GetHWCodecDenyList()`** — package-level API in `hwdecode.go`. Populates `hwCodecDenyList map[string]struct{}` from a comma-separated string of FFmpeg codec names. `codecCanUseHWDevice` checks the deny-list before the built-in allowlist, unconditionally falling back to SW decode for listed codecs.
- **`PrefsConfig.HWCodecDenyList string`** — persisted in `settings.json` (JSON key `HWCodecDenyList`). Loaded by `initNativeMediaAssets` at startup via `setHWCodecDenyList(s.prefs.HWCodecDenyList)`. Updated by adapter method `SetHWCodecDenyList`.
- **Settings → Player — "HW Decode Deny-List" text entry** — `hwDenyListEntry` placed below the HW decode auto-detect section. Placeholder: `e.g. vc1,wmv3,mpeg2video`. Changes are applied immediately and saved. Uses `t.SettingsHWDenyList` / `t.SettingsHWDenyListHint` i18n keys (all 4 locales).

### Error Resilience — Explicit `FF_EC_GUESS_MVS | FF_EC_DEBLOCK`

- **`setVideoCodecErrorFlags(ctx *C.AVCodecContext)`** — package-level helper in `engine.go` that sets `ctx->error_concealment = FF_EC_GUESS_MVS | FF_EC_DEBLOCK` before `avcodec_open2`. Called on both video codec init paths: `SelectVideoTrack` and `openFinalize` SW decode path. FFmpeg's default for this field already matches, but `avcodec_parameters_to_context` can reset it; explicit assignment makes the intent clear and guards against future FFmpeg default changes. Motion-vector extrapolation (GUESS_MVS) and deblocking (DEBLOCK) are now guaranteed active on corrupt or streamed content.

### Mid-Playback Audio and Subtitle Track Switching

- **`Engine.SelectAudioTrack` use-after-free fixed** — Previous implementation freed `audioCodecCtx` while the `audioDecodeLoop` goroutine (running inside the old `AudioPlayer`) was still using it. Fixed ordering: close `AudioPlayer` first (stops goroutine), then flush queue, then free codec, then open new codec. New `AudioPlayer` has `thread_count=1` (matching `openFinalize`), restores speed/volume/muted state, seeks to current video PTS for A/V resync, and resumes if engine was playing.
- **`Engine.SelectSubtitleTrack` codec reinit** — Previously only updated `subtitleStreamIdx` without reinitialising the codec context, causing the old stream's codec to decode packets from the new stream. Fixed: flushes `subtitleQueue`, frees old `subtitleCodecCtx`, calls `initSubtitleDecoder` for the new stream index, clears stale on-screen subtitle.
- **`Engine.subtitleCodecMu`** — New `sync.Mutex` (level 3.5) protects all `subtitleCodecCtx` access. Guards: `demuxerLoop` stream routing check, `NextFrame` subtitle decode branch, `decodeSubtitle` per-packet decode call, `SelectSubtitleTrack` reinit, `DisableSubtitles`, and `Close`. Eliminates data race between the playback goroutine and UI-initiated track switches.

### HW Decode Default-On + Error Concealment

- **`hwDecodeEnabled` default flipped to `true`** (`internal/media/hwdecode.go`) — D3D11VA/VAAPI/QSV now active by default. All FFmpeg call sites in the video decode path are wrapped in `safe_bridge.c` SEH `__try` guards. `DegradeToSoftware()` is wired into the decode loop and falls back to SW on the first HW failure. Previously held at `false` pending SEH coverage; coverage was confirmed complete.
- **Error concealment — last-good-frame** (`internal/media/engine.go`, `internal/media/playback.go`) — `Engine.lastGoodFrame atomic.Pointer[image.RGBA]` stores the most recently displayed frame. `Engine.decodeErrored atomic.Bool` is set on fatal decode errors (SEH exception or already-degraded SW failure). On decode-error EOF, `NextFrame` returns the frozen last frame exactly once via `CompareAndSwap(true, false)` instead of going black, then propagates `io.EOF`. Natural EOF (file ends cleanly) is unaffected.

### ASS Subtitle Format Fixes

- **`formatASSTime` centiseconds bug** — `int(d.Milliseconds()) / 10` used total milliseconds, producing values like `372345` instead of `45`. Fixed to `(int(d.Milliseconds()) % 1000) / 10` to isolate the sub-second component before dividing.
- **`escapeASSText` closing-brace over-escape** — `}` was being escaped to `\}`, producing `\{bold\}` instead of `\{bold}`. In ASS format only `{` (tag opener) needs escaping; `}` alone is not a special character. Removed the `}` replacement.

### P1-5: A-B Loop

- **`Engine.SetLoopPoints(a, b float64)` / `SetABLoopEnabled(bool)`** — stores loopA and loopB PTS thresholds; when enabled, `NextFrame` checks PTS after each decoded frame and seeks back to loopA when PTS >= loopB. Loop-back scheduled via `abLoopPending` flag on next `NextFrame` call, returning the frame at B first.
- **`InlineVideoPlayer.SetABLoopEnabled(bool)` / `SetLoopPoints(a, b float64)`** — forwards to Engine through the standard InlineVideoPlayer API layer.
- **Zero overhead when disabled** — `abLoopEnabled` check is a single `IsABLoopEnabled()` call after each frame decode; no branching cost for normal playback when disabled.

### P1-8: Frame Timing Diagnostics Overlay

- **`InlineVideoPlayer.SetFrameTimingOverlayVisible(bool)`** — toggle drives `VideoPlayer.SetFrameTimingVisible` flag; overlay renders in top-right corner showing: sequential frame count, PTS (s), inter-frame delta (ms), and PTS delta (s).
- **Per-frame collection at InlineVideoPlayer level** — frame count, last PTS, and last-received timestamp tracked in `InlineVideoPlayer` fields; formatted string pushed to widget via `DoFromGoroutine` each frame.
- **Semi-transparent background** — auto-sized to text width using `fyne.MeasureText`; green monospace text on dark background.

### P1-11: Clock Drift Correction

- **`MasterClock.SetTime()` underrun recovery** at `internal/media/clock.go:58-66`: the monotonic ratchet now allows a backward reset when `backwardJump > 1s` AND `time.Since(c.ptsTime) > 500ms`. This detects the "audio was silent, clock coasted on wall-time, audio recovered with a stale PTS" scenario. Without it, the clock would drift permanently forward and subsequent video frames at the correct PTS would be rejected as too late.

### P1-10: Growing/In-Progress File Support

- **`Engine.SetGrowingFile(bool)` / `IsGrowingFile()`** — atomic toggle alongside `looping`, wired through `InlineVideoPlayer.SetGrowingFile(bool)`.
- **`InlineVideoPlayer.growingFileWatcher()`** — goroutine polls `os.Stat` every 2s; on growth, calls `Load(path)` to re-open, `Seek(lastPos)` to restore position, `Play()` to resume.
- **EOF handler modified**: when `eng.IsGrowingFile()` is true, skips `onEnd` callback + `MarkCompleted`, starts watcher instead.

### P1-7: Bilinear Scaling (docs-only)

- **FFmpeg sws_scale confirmed using SWS_BICUBIC** at `engine.go:1445` (video decode → RGBA) and `framepool.go:36` (thumbnail pipeline). The actual colour conversion and dimension scaling have always been bicubic — no code change needed.
- **`scaleNearest` docstring clarified** in `view.go:833` — documented that the nearest-neighbour canvas blit is purely a last-mile positioning step with negligible visual impact. The quality-determining FFmpeg swscale pipeline is and remains SWS_BICUBIC.

### P1-2: Resume/Watch-Later

- **`InlineVideoPlayer` auto-saves playback position** — `resumeState` field + `SetResumeState(s)` method. During `playbackLoop`, saves position every 5s (throttled) via `state.ResumeState.SavePosition()`. On EOF, calls `rs.MarkCompleted()`. On load, auto-restores via `GetPosition()` + `ShouldResume()`.
- **`state/resume.go` build constraint removed** — the `//go:build native_media` tag was unnecessary (pure Go with no CGo/FFmpeg deps), allowing `inline_player_stub.go` to import the package without a matching stub type.
- **Shared ResumeState wired in `initNativeMediaAssets`** — created from `filepath.Join(defaultVideoToolsRoot(), "state")` and set on both `primaryInlinePlayer` and `previewPlayer`. Every module using the shared singletons gets resume for free.
- Trim module retains its independent `ResumeState` (created with empty configDir) for backward compatibility — no functional overlap since it uses a separate state file.

### P1-1: Network/URL Streaming

- **`Engine.OpenURL(url string, opts map[string]string) error`** added to `internal/media/engine.go`: builds AVDictionary with sensible defaults (60s I/O timeout, `reconnect_streamed=1`, `reconnect_on_network_error=1`, `reconnect_delay_max=5`). User-provided opts override defaults. Passes `&dict` to `avformat_open_input` for full network protocol support (HTTP/HTTPS/HLS/DASH/RTSP/RTMP).
- **`InlineVideoPlayer.LoadURL(url string, opts map[string]string) error`** added to `internal/ui/inline_player.go` — follows `loadViaOpen` pattern, same lifecycle as `Load()`/`LoadDVD()`. Stub in `inline_player_stub.go` preserves build without `native_media` tag.

### P0-5: OpenAuto — Open→OpenDVD Fallback

- **`Engine.OpenAuto(path string) error`** — tries `Open()` (generic avformat), falls back to `OpenDVD(path, 0)` (dvdvideo demuxer, longest title) on failure. `InlineVideoPlayer.Load()` now calls `OpenAuto` instead of `Open`, so ISOs and VIDEO_TS directories load automatically in Convert, Inspect, Filters, Upscale, Trim, Audio, and Subtitles modules without explicit disc-aware callers.

### P0-1 + P0-2: HW→SW Decoder Degradation + NextFrame Hang Fix

- **`vt_clear_hw_decode` C helper** (`errors.go`): unrefs `hw_device_ctx` from the codec context, resets the `get_format` callback and `opaque` pointer to NULL, and re-enables `FF_THREAD_SLICE` threading. Prevents the codec from attempting HW pixel-format negotiation after degradation.
- **`DegradeToSoftware()` now fully functional**: previously only freed the engine's HW context references; the codec context still had `hw_device_ctx` set + `get_format` wired, causing the codec to re-init HW on the next decode cycle. Now calls `vt_clear_hw_decode` + `avcodec_flush_buffers` to break the cycle and discard buffered HW frames.
- **`videoDecodeLoop` degradation wired in**: when `retrieveHWFrame` sets `videoDecodeDead=true` (SEH in `av_hwframe_transfer_data` or `sws_scale`), the decode loop now calls `RecordHWFailure()` + `DegradeToSoftware()`, clears the dead flag, and continues. The next iteration runs the SW decode branch (`hwDevice == HWDeviceNone`). If degradation was already attempted and SW is also failing, sends EOF sentinel and exits.
- **EOF sentinel sent on all fatal `videoDecodeLoop` exit paths** (P0-2): `SafeSendPacket` SEH, `SafeReceiveFrame` SEH, and already-degraded fatal path all now send `decodeEOFPTS` into `frameQueue` before returning. `NextFrame` unblocks and returns `io.EOF` instead of hanging forever.

### P0-5: OpenAuto with Open→OpenDVD Fallback

- **`Engine.OpenAuto(path)`** added: tries `Open(path)`, falls back to `OpenDVD(path, 0)` on failure. `InlineVideoPlayer.Load()` now uses `OpenAuto` instead of `Open` — ISOs and VIDEO_TS directories load automatically in every module without calling `LoadDVD()`.

### P0-3: Backward Frame Stepping (un-break StepFrame(-1))

- **`Engine.Step(frames int)`** at `playback.go:335-338` previously rejected `frames <= 0` — all `StepFrame(-1)` callers silently failed. Now handles negative values: seeks back ~2 safety-seconds before the target frame's PTS, then decodes forward `abs(frames)` frames and returns the last one. Uses `GetFrameRate()` to calculate per-frame duration; falls back to position 0 if target < 0.

### P0-4: Error Ring Buffer (replaces single-slot lastError)

- **Replaced `lastError *PlaybackError`** (single slot, written only in dead code, never read) with a 16-entry ring buffer. New `ErrorRecord` struct includes `Timestamp time.Time` so every error carries a temporal trace. Thread-safe via dedicated `errorMu`.
- **`SetError()` wired into all SEH catch paths**: `GrabFrame` send_packet/receive_frame, `videoDecodeLoop` send_packet/receive_frame, `retrieveHWFrame` hwframe_transfer/sws_scale — every CGo crash route now writes to the ring buffer. `DegradeToSoftware()` also uses `SetError()` instead of direct `lastError` assignment.
- **`GetErrorHistory() []ErrorRecord`** returns all entries in chronological order. `GetLastError()` preserved as backward-compat wrapper. `ClearError()` / `ClearErrorHistory()` reset the ring.
- Build clean, 31/31 media tests pass (2 pre-existing ASS subtitle failures unaffected).

### Comprehensive Media Engine Gap Analysis

- **Full audit of every missing player feature** vs. production players (VLC/MPV). 20+ gaps catalogued across 4 phases.
- **DegradeToSoftware confirmed dead code** (`errors.go:57`): HW→SW fallback is inline per-frame, retrying HW on every decode until `videoDecodeDead=true` kills decoding permanently. `DegradeToSoftware()`, `ShouldDegrade()`, `RecordHWFailure()`, `ResetHWFailureCount()` are all unreachable.
- **NextFrame hang after HW crash** (`playback.go:662`): When SEH fires in videoDecodeLoop, remaining frame queue drains then NextFrame blocks forever receiving from a channel that will never get an EOF sentinel.
- **Backward frame stepping broken** (`playback.go:335-338`): `Step(frames)` rejects negative values — all `StepFrame(-1)` callers silently fail.
- **lastError is orphaned dead data** (`engine.go:205`, `errors.go:17-48`): Single `*PlaybackError` pointer written only in dead code, `GetLastError()`/`ClearError()` never called by any module.
- **No network streaming**: `avformat_open_input` gets `nil, nil` — no AVDictionary options for timeout, reconnect, protocol whitelist. FFmpeg natively supports HTTP/HTTPS/HLS/DASH/RTSP/RTMP but VT has no URL opening path.
- **SeekAccuracy locked to Keyframe**: All 3 callers hardcode `SeekAccuracyKeyframe` — Frame and Accurate modes defined but unreachable.
- **Resume/watch-later only in Trim module**: `internal/media/state/resume.go` used exclusively by trim/view.go.
- **No audio delay, speed+pitch correction, A-B loop, bilinear scaling, frame timing overlay, clock drift correction, or growing-file support**.
- **Design document**: `docs/MEDIA_ENGINE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` with tiered list, file:line references, effort estimates, and VLC/MPV comparison.

## v0.1.1-dev49 (May 2026)

### Select / Dropdown — Active Item Text Colour Fix
- **`_fyne/widget/menu_item.go`**: `refreshText()` now uses `ColorNameForegroundOnPrimary` (mapped to `BgBase` #0B0F1A in `VTTheme` — near-black) when the menu item is active, instead of always using `ColorNameForeground` (light text). Active dropdown items render on the `ColorNameFocus` background (VT_Green #22c55e); the previous light text was illegible. Fixes all dropdowns app-wide: Settings, Convert, Filters, Upscale, Rip, etc.

### Media Engine — bwdif Deinterlace
- **Engine-level bwdif deinterlace**: New `internal/media/deinterlace.go` with libavfilter-based bwdif filter graph. Applied in `videoDecodeLoop` and `GrabFrame` when `AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED` is set on the decoded frame. bwdif parameters `mode=0:parity=-1:deint=0` (full-rate output, auto field-order detection, only intervene on flagged frames). Filter graph created lazily on first interlaced frame, cached per video, freed on `Close()`.
- **`toRGBA()` signature extended**: Now accepts optional `*C.AVFrame` parameter (`nil` = use `e.frame`). Deinterlaced frames are passed directly to sws_scale without copying data back to `e.frame`.
- **`AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED` check**: Uses the flags-based API (`frame->flags & AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED`) which is the only portable check across FFmpeg 6.x and 7.x+ (the deprecated `interlaced_frame` field was removed in FFmpeg 7.0).
- **Settings toggle**: "Auto deinterlace" checkbox in Settings → Preferences → Player section, default on. Preference persisted to `PrefsConfig.AutoDeinterlace`. Wired through `InlineVideoPlayer.SetDeinterlaceEnabled()` → `Engine.SetDeinterlaceEnabled()`. Global default via `media.SetDefaultDeinterlaceEnabled()` ensures newly created engines respect the saved preference.
- **i18n**: `SettingsAutoDeinterlace` / `SettingsAutoDeinterlaceHint` keys in all four locale files (en_ca, fr_ca, iu, iu_latin).
- **disc_debug.c double-include fix**: Removed `#include "disc_debug.c"` from `disc_debug.go` C preamble — CGo auto-compiles `.c` files, causing duplicate symbol linker errors. Added `#include <stdlib.h>` for `C.free`.

### Thread Safety Formalisation — Lock Hierarchy & Lockdep
- **Formal lock hierarchy established**: All Engine mutexes follow a documented acquisition order: `mu (level 1) → formatMu (level 2) → videoCodecMu (level 3) → framepoolMu (level 4)`. Clear rules documented in `internal/media/lock.go` and `docs/PLAYER_DEBUG.md`.
- **Lock wrapper helpers**: Every direct `.Lock()`/`.Unlock()` call across 6 Engine files (engine.go, playback.go, errors.go, buffer.go, framepool.go, scrub.go) replaced with named helpers: `lockMu()`/`unlockMu()`, `lockFormatMu()`/`unlockFormatMu()`, `lockVideoCodecMu()`/`unlockVideoCodecMu()`, `lockFramepoolMu()`/`unlockFramepoolMu()`. ~60 call sites migrated.
- **Lockdep runtime verification**: New `lockdep_on.go` (`//go:build lockdep`) uses goroutine-local tracking via `sync.Map` + `runtime.Stack` goroutine ID parsing. Before each lock acquisition, verifies no held lock has level >= new level — panics with reverse-order deadlock diagnostic on violation. `lockdep_off.go` provides no-op stubs for release builds.
- **DegradeToSoftware safety comment**: Documented that this function acquires `mu → videoCodecMu` and must NOT be called while already holding `videoCodecMu`. Currently unused (HW→SW fallback happens inline); added guidance to use `go e.DegradeToSoftware()` if wiring from within videoCodecMu context.
- **framepoolMu comment fixed**: Updated from "must NOT be acquired under videoCodecMu" to reference the formal lock hierarchy — the lock IS acquired under videoCodecMu (in toRGBA) but this is safe because no path ever takes framepoolMu then videoCodecMu.
- **Lock-free atomic fields documented**: `seekFlushBefore`, `seekGen`, `lastVideoPTSBits` use `atomic.Uint64` to avoid the `videoCodecMu → mu` reverse-order deadlock that would occur if they were mutex-guarded.

### Media Engine — Seek Corruption Fix & Player Consolidation
- **Accurate fallback seek corruption fixed**: `Engine.Seek()` (playback.go:179-181) used `AVSEEK_FLAG_ACCURATE` without `AVSEEK_FLAG_BACKWARD`, causing the format context to land mid-GOP. After `avcodec_flush_buffers` destroyed the decoder reference state, the first decoded P/B-frame had no reference I-frame, producing garbled output for 1-3 seconds after every seek that triggered the adaptive accuracy fallback. Fixed by adding `AVSEEK_FLAG_BACKWARD`.
- **Verbose seek logging**: Added human-readable seek flags (`Seek: flags=`), accurate fallback confirmation, clock reset target with audio offset, frame queue drain count, and videoDecodeLoop seekGen change detection logging the first decoded frame's format/dimensions/PTS after each seek.
- **InlineVideoPlayer seek logging**: `InlineVideoPlayer.Seek()` now logs the seek target and the first decoded frame status (`err=%v img=%v`).
- **Player singleton consolidation**: All 10 per-module player singletons consolidated into 2 shared instances — `GetPrimaryPlayer()` (for Convert, Trim, Inspect, Filters, Upscale, Audio, Subtitles) and `GetPreviewPlayer()` (for Filters/Upscale before/after comparison). Per-module getters forward through these. Unused players (`convertPreviewPlayer`, `subtitleInlinePlayer`, `audioInlinePlayer`) retained as backward-compat aliases but now reference the shared instances. `applyPlayerDefaultAspect` updated to iterate only 2 players.
- **Media Engine Architecture document**: Created `docs/MEDIA_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting the full three-layer stack, the 10-player problem, seek architecture with the fixed bug, frame pacing design, known issues, and the consolidation plan.

### Settings — Log File Management
- **Session rotation**: `logging.Init()` now trims the log file to the last 2 sessions on every startup. A `=== VideoTools session started` boundary marker is written at each boot; `rotateLog()` scans for these and discards anything before the most recent previous session. Old binary noise from stale installations disappears automatically after two runs.
- **Clear Log File button**: Settings → Preferences → Log File card. Truncates the active log file in place (no restart needed) and writes a cleared-at timestamp. Useful for a fresh start before sending a log to a tester.
- **Open Log Folder button**: Opens the logs directory in the system file manager.

### Queue & Process Management — File-in-Use & Zombie FFmpeg Fixes
- **`NoInheritHandles` on Windows subprocess creation** (`internal/utils/exec_windows.go`): `SysProcAttr` now sets `NoInheritHandles: true` on both `CreateCommand` and `CreateCommandRaw`. Previously, the VT media engine's open `avformat_open_input` file handles were inherited by every FFmpeg subprocess, holding the source video file open for the lifetime of the encode. On Windows, this caused "file in use" errors when deleting or moving the source file after conversion. `NoInheritHandles: true` prevents any parent handles from being duplicated into child processes.
- **`Queue.Stop()` cancels running jobs** (`internal/queue/queue.go`): `Stop()` — called on app window close via `s.shutdown()` — now invokes `cancelRunningLocked()` before clearing the `running` flag. Previously, closing VT while a conversion was in progress left the FFmpeg subprocess running as an orphan. Context cancellation now propagates through `exec.CommandContext` to terminate the child process cleanly when the app closes.
- **Windows Job Object — crash-resistant child process cleanup** (`internal/utils/jobobject_windows.go`): `utils.InitJobObject()` (called at app startup) creates a Windows Job Object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`. All long-running encode processes are assigned to it immediately after start via `utils.StartCmd()`. When VT exits for **any** reason — clean shutdown or crash — Windows automatically kills all Job Object members. Covers the 4K crash scenario where `Queue.Stop()` is never reached because VT itself goes down.
- **Linux `Pdeathsig: SIGKILL`** (`internal/utils/exec_linux.go`): Linux `CreateCommand`/`CreateCommandRaw` now set `SysProcAttr.Pdeathsig = syscall.SIGKILL`. The kernel automatically sends SIGKILL to every child process when the parent (VT) process exits, with no cooperative shutdown required.
- **`utils.StartCmd()` replaces `cmd.Start()` at all encode sites**: All long-running FFmpeg invocations in `main.go`, `rip/executor.go`, `audio/executor.go`, `thumbnail/generator.go`, and `interlace/detector.go` now go through `StartCmd`. On Windows this assigns each process to the Job Object; on Linux `Pdeathsig` is already in `SysProcAttr` from `CreateCommand`.

### Queue Module — Convert Navigation & Progress Refresh Bug Fixes
- **Blocking dialog removed**: `convertNow()` no longer shows `dialog.ShowInformation` after queuing a job. Replaced with direct `s.showQueue()` — user is taken straight to the queue to watch progress. Previously, a modal dialog blocked the view; on fast hardware (e.g. AMF AV1 at 10× speed), the encode completed before the user could dismiss it.
- **Queue auto-refresh goroutine self-exit fixed**: `startQueueAutoRefresh` and `startQueueElapsedTicker` in `queue_module.go` both used `return` in the ticker case when `s.active != "queue"`, silently killing the goroutine while leaving `queueAutoRefreshRunning`/`queueElapsedRunning = true`. The next `showQueue()` call became a no-op (guard returned early), so the progress bar never updated. Fixed by changing both `return` statements to `continue`.

### Convert Module — Collapsible Section Header Bars (BuildCollapsibleHeader)
- **`internal/ui/collapsible.go`**: New `tappableBox` widget (implements `fyne.Tappable` via `widget.BaseWidget`) and `BuildCollapsibleHeader` function. Returns a full-width module-colored accent bar (CornerRadius 10, height 34) with uppercase bold ▼/▶ label matching the `buildConvertBox`/`buildRipBox` visual pattern. Accepts `extraRight` widgets and an `onToggle(open bool)` callback.
- **Metadata panel collapse**: Metadata header is now a tappable `BuildCollapsibleHeader` bar labeled "▼ METADATA" / "▶ METADATA" with module color. Drives `leftColumn` VSplit (expanded 0.5 ↔ collapsed 0.97). Copy/Clear action buttons remain in the header right side.
- **Settings panel collapse**: Settings column header is a tappable `BuildCollapsibleHeader` bar labeled "▼ SETTINGS" / "▶ SETTINGS". Drives `mainSplit` (expanded 0.65 ↔ collapsed 0.97). Replaces the old pill button in the top nav bar.
- **`ConvertSectionSettings` i18n key**: New key added across all four locale files (en_ca, fr_ca, iu, iu_latin) for the settings section label.
- **Rip log relabeled**: Log toggle pill now reads "▼ LOG" / "▶ LOG" (was bare ▼/▶ arrows).

### Rip Module — Layout Alignment to Convert Style
- **Player panel width**: HSplit offset 0.40 → 0.65; player now takes two-thirds of the module width, matching the Convert module's spatial balance.
- **Section boxes**: Controls panel restructured with `buildRipBox()` header sections (teal accent bars) matching Convert's `buildConvertBox()` visual pattern — four sections: Source, Format, Output, Status.
- **Open in Player relocated**: Button moved from below the player canvas into the module footer action bar alongside the queue/rip buttons.
- **Collapsible log**: ▼/▶ toggle in the RIP LOG console header collapses/expands the log section (logVSplit: expanded 0.60, collapsed 0.97). Log is proportionally larger when open (was 0.75 → now 0.60 main/log split).

### Rip Module — Menu Bleed, Chapters & Multi-Title Export
- **Menu VOB bleed fixed**: `CollectVOBSets` now excludes `VTS_XX_0.VOB` (menu VOB) from content title sets. Previously the menu VOB was concatenated at the start of every rip, causing menu frames to glitch into the output video and shifting all chapter timestamps by the menu duration.
- **Chapter embedding diagnostics**: Added verbose logging of chapter count, first/last timestamp, and embed decision to rip log for easier debugging.
- **Menu preservation option**: New `IncludeMenus` config option + "Preserve menus" checkbox in rip view. When enabled, menu VOBs (`VIDEO_TS.VOB` + all `VTS_XX_0.VOB`) are exported as separate files alongside the main rip. Output naming `{base}_Menu_{VTS_Name}.{ext}`.
- **Main/extra title naming**: The longest title (main feature) uses the main output path; shorter titles use `_Extra_Title_NN` suffix instead of the previous `_Title_NN` for all titles. Title selection UI marks the main feature with a star indicator.

### Inuktitut Transliteration — Auto-Fill Missing Script Variants
- **New `internal/i18n/translit/` package**: Pure-Go implementation of the iutools syllabics↔roman transliteration algorithm (MIT-licensed, National Research Council Canada). 270-entry mapping tables across all 15 Inuktitut consonant series plus short/long vowels, finals, and `lh` ASCII fallback for `ł`.
- **Syllabics→Roman**: Handles compound sequences (r/q finals + k-series → rq/qq+vowel; ng/nng finals + g-series → ng/nng+vowel).
- **Roman→Syllabics**: Greedy longest-prefix hash-table matching; `%`-verb escaping preserves printf format specifiers through translation.
- **Script detection helpers**: `IsSyllabics(s)`, `SyllabicRatio(s)` for identifying script type; `RomanOnly(v)` mode toggle.
- **i18n integration**: `translitFill()` wired into `SetLanguageWithScript`. Empty Inuktitut fields auto-filled from the other script variant via transliteration. Manually-entered strings take precedence as overrides.
- **Test coverage**: 15 unit tests (276 round-trip assertions) + 3 integration tests for the i18n↔translit bridge — all passing.

### Frame Pacing — PTS-Driven Timing Overhaul
- **No-audio WaitForPTS**: Replaced `e.clock.SetTime(pts)` with `e.clock.WaitForPTS(pts)` in `NextFrame` for audio-less playback. The clock now ticks forward in real time between frames; `WaitForPTS` blocks for the correct PTS interval (e.g. 41.7ms at 24fps), eliminating the previous decode-speed pacing that caused non-smooth video.
- **Removed WaitVsync from playbackLoop**: The `DwmFlush()` call after every `NextFrame` introduced 0-16.7ms of per-frame jitter (ΔV up to ±16.7ms on frame intervals). Frame timing is now purely PTS-driven, removing all vsync-alignment jitter.
- **Frame rate propagation**: `VideoPlayer.SetFrameRate()` now called during `loadViaOpen` from `Engine.GetFrameRate()`, giving the player widget frame-accurate display configuration.

### VT Media Engine — Subsystem Split
- **engine.go (3245→1117 lines)**: Broken into 6 focused subsystem files — errors.go, hwdecode.go, framepool.go, subtitle_engine.go, buffer.go, playback.go. framepool.go extracts frame buffer pool (toRGBA/ReleaseFrame/GetFramePoolSize/ensureSwsCtx). subtitle_engine.go extracts subtitle decoding+rendering (SubtitleOverlay, initSubtitleDecoder, decodeSubtitle, RenderSubtitles, drawBitmapText). buffer.go extracts buffer management (SetBufferMode, recordDecodeTime, AdjustBufferForPerformance, GetBufferHealth). playback.go extracts the entire playback pipeline (Start, demuxerLoop, Seek, ResetAfterGrab, GrabFrame, videoDecodeLoop, NextFrame, Pause, Resume, Close, Duration, etc.) plus all query helpers.
- **view.go (1438 lines)**: VideoPlayer widget split into control_overlay.go, keyboard_shortcuts.go, thumbnail_preview.go — deferred to dev50.
- **Player interface**: Extracting formal Go `Player` interface from `InlineVideoPlayer` for mock-based unit tests — deferred to dev50.
- **HW decode default-on**: Re-evaluating D3D11VA default with VEH/SEH crash bridge coverage; per-codec HW blacklist for known-crash decoders.
- **Thread safety formalisation**: Lock hierarchy documentation, lockdep-style assertions, elimination of reverse-order lock paths (e.g. DegradeToSoftware).

### VT ISO Engine — Production Hardening
- **UDF reader robustness**: Fallback sector scanning for non-standard AVDP locations; format validation on all descriptor parsing; multi-extent file support; ISO 9660 bridge for non-UDF discs.
- **Thread safety & progress**: Mutex-guarded Reader for concurrent access; extraction progress callbacks/channels; temp file tracking for crash-safe cleanup.

### Rip Module — Source Section Rework
- **Disc info moved to Source**: `discInfoLabel` (type/region/size) relocated from the Format box to the Source section, so basic disc metadata is visible directly under the source path entry.
- **Single browse button**: ISO... and Folder... buttons replaced with a single `...` button that opens a 900×640 file dialog. Folder selection is handled via drag-and-drop on the droppable source entry.
- **Format validation**: `loadDisc` now rejects non-ISO/non-VIDEO_TS paths with a user-visible error message (`RipErrNotDisc`) shown in the disc info label, instead of silently failing.

### Player — Configurable Idle Aspect Ratio
- **Settings → Preferences**: New "Idle Aspect Ratio" dropdown (4:3, 16:9, 5:3, 21:9, 9:16) controls the aspect ratio of SMPTE colour bars displayed when no video is loaded. Persisted as `PlayerDefaultAspect` in `PrefsConfig`.
- **VideoPlayer field**: `idleAspectRatio` field with `SetIdleAspectRatio`/`IdleAspectRatio` methods; `draw()` uses `IdleAspectRatio()` instead of hardcoded `4.0/3.0`.
- **InlineVideoPlayer forwarding**: `SetIdleAspectRatio` method on `InlineVideoPlayer` forwards to the underlying `VideoPlayer`. All player singletons updated at startup and on pref change.

### C Disc Debug Utility
- **New `internal/media/disc_debug.{c,h,go}`**: C-level debug tools for probing DVD/VIDEO_TS file systems via Win32 `FindFirstFile` / POSIX `opendir`. `DiscDebugHexDump` reads IFO file headers; `DiscDebugListDir` lists directory contents with sizes; `DiscDebugDirStat` returns file count and total size.
- **Build-gated**: `native_media` build tag; no-op stubs for non-native-media builds.

## v0.1.1-dev48 (May 2026)

### Theme System — internal/theme/ Package
- **VT_Navy colour palette** extracted to `internal/theme/palette.go` — BgBase/BgDark/BgLight/BgCard, Border/BorderDim, Text/TextMuted, InputBg, all status colours.
- **PillButton widget** moved to `internal/theme/pillbutton.go` — pill shape, coloured border, hover/active/disabled states, bold text, initial-paint fix (r.Refresh() in CreateRenderer).
- **PillIconButton widget** — `internal/theme/pilliconbutton.go` — square icon-only pill button for transport controls and toolbar actions.
- **Text primitives** — `NewTitleLabel`, `NewSectionLabel`, `NewWrappingLabel`, `NewHintLabel`, `NewMonoLabel` in `internal/theme/text.go`.
- **MonoTheme + main.go** — both now reference theme vars instead of hardcoded hex strings.
- **Circular dependency resolved** — `ui/` re-exports theme symbols for backward compat; `media/` imports theme directly.

### Player: Transport Controls Migrated
- **speedBtn / subtitleBtn** — migrated from `widget.Button` to `theme.PillButton` with consistent pill styling.
- **playBtn / volumeBtn / prevChapterBtn / nextChapterBtn / fullscreenBtn / pipBtn** — migrated to `theme.PillIconButton`.
- All transport buttons share navy-light background, hover border lightens, no invisible-first-paint bug.

### Bug Fixes
- **Audio nil-widget crash** — `Player.Widget()` nil guard in Audio view; HSplit never receives nil.
- **PillButton initial paint** — `CreateRenderer` now calls `r.Refresh()` so colours render on first paint (buttons were invisible until hover).
- **Window recentering** — removed `CenterOnScreen()` from `maximizeWindow`; window position is preserved across module entries.
- **i18n: Inuktitut script preference** — script choice (syllabics vs Latin) now persists across language switches and survives app restarts via `ScriptPrefs` in locale JSON.

### Full Module Button + Slider Migration
- **MakePillButton / MakePillIconButton** — renamed from `NewPillButton`/`NewPillIconButton` to follow Go widget factory naming convention (`MakeXxx`).
- **All module-level `widget.Button` calls migrated** — every call to `widget.NewButton` / `widget.NewButtonWithIcon` across all module files replaced with `ui.MakePillButton` / `ui.MakePillIconButton`. Covered: convert, trim, merge, filters, audio, upscale, rip, author, burn, compare, subtitles, thumbnail, inspect, queue, settings, about, utils.
- **`widget.Slider` → `ui.Slider` / `ui.MakeSlider`** — every raw `widget.Slider` / `widget.NewSlider` replaced with the styled `ui.Slider` type (VT theme, label, min/max display). `widget.ProgressBar` → `ui.MakeSlider` where used as a display-only bar.
- **Slider naming** — canonical names confirmed: `ui.Slider` (type) and `ui.MakeSlider` (constructor); no `VTSlider`, no `NewVTSlider`, no `NewSlider` prefix variants.

### Player: STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW Recovery
- **VEH extension in `safe_bridge.c`** — Vectored Exception Handler now catches both `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` and `STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW (0xC00000FD)`. `_resetstkoflw()` called before `longjmp` to restore the stack guard page; `tl_veh_code` thread-local stores the exception code so callers can distinguish crash types.
- **New return code** — `SAFE_BRIDGE_STACK_OVERFLOW (0xDEAD0003)` added to `safe_bridge.h`; callers log the stack overflow distinctly from access violations.
- **4 MB default thread stack** — `#cgo windows LDFLAGS: -Wl,--stack,4194304` in `internal/media/engine.go` raises the PE default thread stack from 1 MB to 4 MB. This prevents the `glfw.CreateWindow()` stack overflow triggered by GPU driver DLL injection on first window creation.
- **`CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW`** — Go's CGO security scanner rejects flags whose argument starts with `-`. The flag is allowed via `CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW=-Wl,--stack,.*` added to `scripts/windows/build.ps1` and `.github/workflows/windows-msix.yml`.

### Player: Dual Before/After Player Sync
- **`InlineVideoPlayer.SetPeer()`** — new method designates a follower player that mirrors every Play/Pause/Seek from the primary. Peer's built-in transport overlay is disabled via `DisableBuiltinControls()`. Lock discipline: `peer` captured under `v.mu`, then peer methods called outside the lock to prevent cross-mutex deadlock.
- **Filters module wired** — `filtersInlinePlayer.SetPeer(filtersPreviewPlayer)` in `native_media.go`; preview player muted after load succeeds.
- **Upscale module wired** — `upscaleInlinePlayer.SetPeer(upscalePreviewPlayer)` in `native_media.go`; preview player muted after load succeeds.
- **Goroutine dispatch** — peer Play/Pause/Seek are dispatched via `go peer.Method()` so the primary player's lock is never held during the call.

### Button Straggler Migrations (dev48 close)
- **About dialog** — 2 `widget.NewButton` → `MakePillButton` (Logs Link, Open).
- **Compare fullscreen** — 2 `widget.NewButton` (backBtn) → `MakePillButton` in both native + stub paths.
- **Settings tabs** — 2 `widget.NewButton` (testPatternBtn, refreshBtn) → `MakePillButton`.
- **Command Editor** — 5 `widget.NewButtonWithIcon` + 2 `widget.NewButton` → all text-only `MakePillButton`. Struct fields `*widget.Button` → `*PillButton`. Removed unused `theme` import.
- **MakeIconButton** — return type `*widget.Button` → `fyne.CanvasObject`; reverted to internal `widget.NewButton` to avoid `utils → ui → benchmark → utils` import cycle.
- **Transport icon buttons** — 18 `widget.NewButtonWithIcon` in `convert_player_native.go` + `main.go` left as-is: blocked on PillIconButton lacking dynamic `SetIcon()` for play↔pause switching.

### CI & Diagnostics
- **Windows signing** — `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` added to Forgejo secrets; `SIGNPATH_ORGANIZATION_ID` already present. ci-build.ps1 calls sign-exe.ps1 non-fatally on every Windows build.
- **Cache guard** — require `ffmpeg.exe` present on disk before skipping BtbN download on cache hit.
- **ci-build.ps1 encoding** — replaced UTF-8 em dashes with ASCII `--` for PowerShell 5.1 compatibility.
- **Startup crash diagnostics** — `VT_STARTUP_DEBUG=1` env var enables per-widget CreateRenderer tracing to stderr. `logging.Sync()` force-flushes log file at crash-risk checkpoints. Root cause of `STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW` confirmed as GPU driver DLL injection inside `glfw.CreateWindow()` — mitigated by 4 MB default stack and VEH recovery (see Player section above).
- **Windows MSIX CI: `CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW`** — `$env:CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW = "-Wl,--stack,.*"` added to `.github/workflows/windows-msix.yml` build step so the 4 MB stack `#cgo LDFLAGS` flag passes the CGO security scanner in the GitHub Actions pipeline.

### Roadmap Visual Polish
- **Deprecated status** — purple (`#a855f7`), no strikethrough, differentiated by border/glow only.
- **Cycle filter row** — dynamically built from roadmap data, sorted newest-first; current version gets VT green outline.
- **Testing Checklist modal** — pass/fail/untested per item, localStorage persistence, grouped by module, summary bar.
- **Column reorder** — empty columns drift right; module-filtered columns hidden.
- **Back-to-top button** — appears at 300px scroll on long boards.
- **VT logo** — 96px, right-aligned, `align-items: flex-start` so logo top aligns with title.
- **Modal drag-to-scroll** — changelog and checklist modals support click-and-drag vertical scrolling.
- **Colour dots** — 16px circles across legend, status filter, and module filter buttons (standardised from 12px/7px).
- **Future status** — changed from grey to orange (`#f97316`) with orange glow gradient on cards.

## v0.1.1-dev47 (May 2026)

### PAL→NTSC Full-Disc Conversion Pipeline — Stages 1-3

- **Full-disc extraction mode** — New "Full disc extraction (DVD-Video with IFO regeneration)" checkbox in Rip module. Enabled when region conversion is active, iterates ALL VTS sets + VIDEO_TS.VOB menu.
- **DVD-compliant MPEG-2 conversion** — Each VTS set re-encoded as MPEG-2 video + AC-3 audio with region conversion filter chain (yadif deinterlace, scale, fps, atempo).
- **Menu VOB processing** — `CollectMenuVOB()` gathers VIDEO_TS.VOB for conversion alongside title VOBs.
- **IFO/BUP regeneration** — New `RegenerateIFOs()` in `internal/app/modules/rip/ifo_regen.go` reads original IFO structure and writes new VTS and VMG IFO files with correct NTSC/PAL attributes, PGC timing, TMAPT sector maps, and chapter tables.
- **New API** — `ExecuteOptions.ExtractMode` field ("main" or "full").
- **New files:** `internal/app/modules/rip/ifo_regen.go`

## v0.1.1-dev46 (June 2026)

### Quick Access Dropdown - Functional
- **FilesDropdownData wired** — `CurrentModule`, `RecentFiles`, `OnFileClick` passed to `BuildMainMenu()`
- **OnOpenFolder callback** — Opens current module's output folder via explorer
- **OnOpenMore callback** — Loads file into current module (`loadVideo()` for most)
- **Recent files navigation** — Clicking recent file opens it in correct module

### Windows CI Fix
- **Build FFmpeg shared DLLs** — Added `build-ffmpeg-shared.ps1` step in Windows CI job
- **Bundle DLLs in release** — `DLL/` subfolder now included in Windows ZIP
- **Fix missing Windows artifacts** — DLLs now built before packaging

### FFmpeg DLL Bootstrap (from dev45)
- **Bundle DLLs in release** — FFmpeg shared DLLs built from source with all deps statically linked
- **Remove BtbN download** — `ffmpeg_bootstrap.go` no longer downloads from BtbN (eliminates `liblzma-5.dll` errors)
- **Build script** — `scripts/windows/build-ffmpeg-shared.ps1` builds FFmpeg shared DLLs from source
- **Legacy fallback** — `FFmpegDllDir()` still checks `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VideoTools\DLL` for old installs

---

- **Fix rip module** — `CatRip` → `CatDisc` in `rip_module.go`
- **Fix recentfiles.go** — `CatSystem` misuse → `CatUI` via `cat()` helper

### FFmpeg DLL Bootstrap Fix (dev45)
- **Bundle DLLs in release** — FFmpeg shared DLLs built from source with all deps statically linked
- **Remove BtbN download** — `ffmpeg_bootstrap.go` no longer downloads from BtbN (eliminates `liblzma-5.dll` errors)
- **Build script** — `scripts/windows/build-ffmpeg-shared.ps1` builds FFmpeg shared DLLs from source
- **CI update** — `ci-build.ps1` bundles DLLs in `DLL/` subfolder (not root) within release ZIP
- **Legacy fallback** — `FFmpegDllDir()` still checks `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VideoTools\DLL` for old installs

### Queue Module UI Polish (dev44)

- **`&&` button** — Main menu header reflects state (off / glowing / showing "A → ?")
- **Module tile dimming** — Invalid Step 2 targets dimmed when in "pick Step 2" state
- **Queue integration** — `PipelineAfter` + `PipelineDeleteOnSuccess` fields on `queue.Job`
- **Intermediate files** — "Keep intermediate files" toggle in Settings → Preferences

---

## v0.1.1-dev44 (April 2026)

### Native Media Player — Playback & Sync Fixes
- **Start/Resume state fix** — `Start()` was setting `e.paused=false` before starting the decode goroutine, but `Resume()` checked `!e.paused` and returned early. Decode loop never started on Play. Fixed: `Start()` now sets `e.paused=false` after launching goroutines.
- **Audio/video sync on load** — Audio clock drifted during `Load()` because `audioDecodeLoop` ran during `GrabFrame`, causing ~5 second offset before playback. Fixed by resetting clock to 0 in `ResetAfterGrab`.
- **Test pattern font** — Test pattern always renders with VCR OSD Mono font regardless of user preference.
- **FFmpeg bootstrap simplification** — Always downloads BtbN pre-built package to guarantee complete DLL set (avoids local installs with missing dependencies like liblzma).

### Settings
- **Player font preference** — Users can choose between IBM Plex Mono and VCR OSD Mono for the OSD. VCR OSD Mono has no Bold/Italic variants; UI gracefully falls back to Regular weight.

### Known Issues (documented for tracker)
- See `docs/PLAYER_DEBUG.md` for full list of known player issues including: `predecodeFrom` sharing `formatCtx` with `demuxerLoop`, audio queue not flushed before seek, speed changes not affecting audio tempo, D3D11VA crashes when enabled.

## v0.1.1-dev43 (April 2026)

### Native Media Player — Thread-Safety & Crash Fixes
- **Pixel format crash fix** — `GrabFrame` and `NextFrame` now derive the `sws` pixel format from `frame.format` (the actual decoded format) rather than `videoCodecCtx.pix_fmt`, which is `AV_PIX_FMT_NONE` until the codec parses its first SPS. A nil `swsCtx` produced by `sws_getContext` caused an unrecoverable C SIGSEGV inside `sws_scale`. `NextFrame`'s SW decode path was also missing the `ensureSwsCtx` call entirely.
- **Close/demuxer race** — Added `sync.WaitGroup demuxerWg` to `Engine`. `demuxerLoop` signals Done on exit. `Engine.Close()` now waits for the demuxer to fully exit before freeing `formatCtx`, `videoCodecCtx`, or any other FFmpeg resource, eliminating the use-after-free crash window.
- **NextFrame/Close codec race** — `Close()` acquires `videoCodecMu` before freeing `videoCodecCtx`, ensuring any in-flight `NextFrame` decode cycle has completed first.
- **seekLoop goroutine leak** — `InlineVideoPlayer.seekCh` was never closed, leaking the `seekLoop` goroutine on every `Close()`. Ownership moved to `Load()`: channel is closed and reallocated per file. `Close()` closes the channel to drain the goroutine. The `OnSeek` widget callback guards against a nil channel under the player mutex.

## v0.1.1-dev42 (April 2026)

### Native Media Player — GStreamer Removal
- **GStreamer fully removed** — All `internal/player/gstreamer*` deleted; `native_media` build tag is the only player path. No more GStreamer dependency at runtime or build time.
- **Player lifecycle fix** — `closeNativePlayer()` prevents audio hanging on module switch; `Widget().Refresh()` deferred after canvas swap.

### Native Media Player — D3D11VA / HW Decode Stabilisation
- **D3D11VA get_format callback** — Accepts `AV_PIX_FMT_D3D11VA_VLD` so D3D11VA decode starts on first packet.
- **H.264 + D3D11VA crash fix** — Pre-warm D3D11VA before first decode call.
- **Dedicated HW frame buffers** — Separate `hwFramesCtx` prevents races between HW download and SW display paths.
- **Lazy swsCtx creation** — Created on first `toRGBA()` call; avoids crash from invalid pixel format before first HW decode.
- **HW frame transfer mutex** — `videoCodecMu` held during HW→SW transfer; eliminates concurrent AVCodecContext access.
- **HW decode codec filtering** — Only codecs that work without `get_format` callback get HW decode enabled.
- **AV_NOPTS_VALUE guard** — Skip frames with invalid PTS instead of passing them downstream.
- **D3D11VA flush guard** — `avcodec_flush_buffers` skipped before first decoded frame.
- **Safe HW frame download** — `av_hwframe_transfer_data` wrapped in recover/retry; falls back to SW decode on failure.

### Native Media Player — Audio / A-V Sync
- **A/V clock fix** — Master clock `SetSpeed()` wired after speed changes; no more 2× playback after resume.
- **AudioPlayer.Read() non-blocking** — Returns immediately on empty buffer; prevents playback hang.
- **Audio seek serialisation** — Codec operations serialized against `Seek()`; prevents hard crash from concurrent access.
- **Pause spin-loop fix** — Sleep instead of busy-wait; `Close()` no longer races with pause state.
- **Audio context pre-warm** — Created at startup to avoid WASAPI initialization hang.
- **SetSpeed deadlock fix** — Speed changes no longer block the audio callback thread.

### Native Media Player — SMPTE Bars & Idle State
- **SMPTE colour bars** — Click-to-load dialog when no video is loaded; consistent across all module players.
- **4:3 ratio with letterboxing** — Proper aspect ratio regardless of player size.
- **Dynamic sizing** — Bars scale to player widget dimensions instead of fixed 1920×1080.
- **Proportional idle text** — "Click to load video" text scales with bar width.

### Native Media Player — Misc
- **Native Fyne icons** — Replaced emoji transport controls with `theme.IconName` equivalents.
- **SmoothScrubbing crash fix** — Fixed crash on HW-decoded frames in thumbnail scrubber.
- **GrabFrame deadlock fix** — Invalid PTS frames no longer block the decode loop.
- **Letterbox fill** — Removed per-frame debug log; fixed fill colour on dark backgrounds.

### Convert Module
- **Clear button for output folder** — One-click reset of the output directory field.
- **Output directory creation** — Directories created before running convert/thumbnail/filter jobs.
- **Drag-drop first frame** — First frame appears immediately after file drop.

### Audio Module
- **VSplit layout** — Replaced custom HSplit with `container.NewVSplit`.
- **Stats bar footer** — Added to Audio module.
- **i18n** — All user-facing strings use i18n keys.
- **Drop label wrapping** — Cleaner layout on narrow windows.

### Thumbnail Module
- **3-way output mode** — Individual / Contact Sheet / Both selector replaces boolean toggle.
- **Image inspector** — Click any thumbnail or contact sheet tile to inspect at full window size.
- **Contact sheet pad crash fix** — `trim` filter removed; time window via `-ss`/`-t` input options.
- **CRLF line-break fix** — `\r` trimmed from ffprobe output on Windows.
- **Per-file "Add All to Queue"** — Creates individual jobs per file instead of a single batch.

### Subtitles Module
- **Video preview player** — Added video preview with synced subtitle overlay.

### CI & Build
- **libdrm-dev** — Added to Linux CI for FFmpeg build.
- **FFmpeg hwaccel disabled in CI** — Avoids libdrm runtime dependency.
- **Update status icon** — Replaced ⬤ with ● for cross-platform rendering.

### Misc
- **Temp file cleanup** — Preview-frame and cover-art temp files cleaned on video unload.
- **FFmpeg install button removed** — FFmpeg bundled in binary; redundant button removed.

## v0.1.1-dev41 (April 2026)

### Convert Module
- **Device presets** — Separated from format selector into a dedicated section; 11 presets (iPhone, Android, PS4, Xbox, Apple TV, etc.) each set ALL encoding variables (codec, bitrate, resolution, audio, pixel format).
- **User-defined presets** — Named presets that capture the full encoding configuration (codec, CRF, bitrate mode, frame rate, hardware accel, aspect, audio, etc.); save / apply / delete from the convert view; persisted to JSON via `appcfg`.
- **Batch output directory** — Batch convert jobs now respect the configured output directory instead of always writing beside the source file.
- **Source frame rate pinning** — `sourceFrameRate` stored in job config; `-r <fps>` explicitly passed to FFmpeg when "Source" is selected, preventing AVI→MP4 re-timestamping (e.g. 25 fps becoming 30 fps).
- **Device preset expansion** — HEVC and AV1 codec options added to device preset definitions.

### Upscale Module
- **Batch queue** — Multiple files can be drag-dropped into the upscale module; all are queued with full config (`targetWidth`, `targetHeight`, `sourceFrameRate`, `preserveAR`, `GroupID`) and the first valid video is shown for review.
- **Real-CUGAN support** — Model catalog abstraction added; Real-CUGAN available as an AI upscaling backend alongside Real-ESRGAN.

### Thumbnail Module
- **Contact sheet pad crash fixed** — `trim` filter removed from filtergraph; time window applied via `-ss`/`-t` input options instead. Eliminates "padded dimensions cannot be smaller than input dimensions" on Xvid/MPEG-4 ASP sources with MCU-padded coded dimensions.
- **Individual thumbnail timestamps fixed** — Timestamps were always `00:00:00.000` because input seek resets the PTS counter. Drawtext now hardcodes the formatted timestamp string (`HH\:MM\:SS.mmm`) for individually-seeked frames; contact sheet continues to use `%{pts:hms}` via `setpts`.
- **`setsar=1` added** — Normalises sample aspect ratio before scale so non-square-pixel sources render correctly.
- **Live preview grid** — Thumbnails appear in the module UI as they are generated. A persistent `GridWrap` container is updated in real time via `OnThumbGenerated`; the grid resets at the start of each new job. Layout redesigned: settings panel (32%) left, live preview panel (68%) right.

### Player Module
- **Routing bug fixed** — Loading a video while in the Player module no longer navigates to the Convert module. `loadVideo` now captures the active module and routes back to `showPlayerView()` when appropriate.
- **File state persistence fixed** — `state.playerFile` was never updated via the file-dialog load path, causing the view to rebuild showing "No video loaded." `OnPlayerFileLoaded` callback added to persist the probed source before the view rebuilds.
- **Layout** — When a video is loaded the player pane fills the full available space via `container.NewBorder` with the video as the expanding center; empty state shows centered instructions and load button.

### UI / Visual
- **Module color alignment** — Subtitles (`#AD741F`), Inspect (`#629C1C`), Upscale (`#2B9C1C`), and Compare (`#91931A`) interior colors now match their main menu button colors.

### DVD Authoring
- **UDF PartitionLength fix** — Calculated from actual file sizes instead of hardcoded 1000 sectors. VLC can now resolve UDF paths for full-size DVDs.
- **Menu PTS timestamps** — Menu VOB PTS was 300x too large (27MHz instead of 90kHz ticks), causing continuous VLC timestamp errors. Fixed.
- **Menu font embedding** — IBM Plex Mono TTF embedded in binary via `go:embed`; no more fallback to generic monospace on installed builds.
- **Chapter navigation** — Chapter cell boundaries now use binary search on actual NAV_PCK PTMs instead of linear interpolation, fixing chapter skip errors on VBR content.
- **Return-to-menu** — `JumpVMGM_PGCN(1)` post-command added to all title PGCs (feature + extras) in both folder and ISO builds.

## v0.1.1-dev40 (April 2026)

### Native Media Player
- **InlineVideoPlayer unified** — All modules (Convert, Trim, Inspect) now use `ui.InlineVideoPlayer` as the single API layer. No module manages its own engine or playback goroutine.
- **Inspect module player** — `GetInspectPlayer()` singleton wired; player widget embedded in Inspect view; `StartThumbnailExtraction` fires on load.
- **Inspect freeze fix** — `probeVideo` (ffprobe subprocess) moved off the main goroutine; UI renders immediately and refreshes when probe completes.
- **EOF handling** — Playback loop distinguishes clean end-of-stream from errors; `SetOnEnd` fires on main goroutine; play button resets correctly.
- **Dual-engine exceptions documented** — Compare and Upscale use two engines directly (required for simultaneous streams); documented in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/NATIVE_PLAYER.md`.

### Logging Standardisation
- **Module categories** — Added `CatConvert`, `CatTrim`, `CatMerge`, `CatFilters`, `CatAudio`, `CatAuthor` log categories.
- **Error elevation** — Config load, probe, and encode failures promoted from `Debug` to `Error` with full path context across Convert, Trim, Merge, Filters, Audio, and Author modules.

### UI / UX
- **Tooltip system** — Global enable/disable in Settings; tooltips on module tiles and Convert controls.
- **Drop targets** — `.ts`, `.m2ts`, `.vob` added to valid video extensions; toast notifications for wrong-format drops; green border hover feedback on drop zones.
- **Trim style** — Player and footer aligned to match other modules.

### Documentation
- **`docs/NATIVE_PLAYER.md`** — Full reference for the three-layer player stack, API surface, module integration pattern, and approved exceptions.
- **`AGENTS.md` Native Player section** — Architecture rule enforced; dual-engine exceptions documented.
- Deleted six stale player docs superseded by the above.

### Bug Fixes
- **Queue right-click safety** — Nil checks prevent crashes on context menu.
- **DnD dispatch** — `DropTarget` wired correctly for Convert and module tile drops.
- **Trim type assertion** — Removed invalid `Widget().(*media.VideoPlayer)` assertion.
- **CI** — Windows build green (runs 1184+); Linux green throughout.

## v0.1.1-dev39 (March 2026)

### Player Module Fixes
- **Panic recovery** — Added defer/recover in player module to catch CGO crashes and show user-friendly error instead of hard crash.
- **FFmpeg DLL consistency** — Now checks for local FFmpeg at `C:\ffmpeg\bin` first (matches compilation), falls back to download only if not found.
- **Local build fix** — Build script now copies FFmpeg DLLs to output directory (matching CI behavior).

### Author Module
- **Interactive Preview tab** — New Preview tab shows full interactive DVD menu preview with working video playback.
- **Module extraction** — Extracted author module to `internal/app/modules/author/`.
- **Tab visibility** — Preview tab only appears when Enable Menus is checked.
- **IFO audio track table** — VTS_MAT audio attributes now correctly reflect actual track codec, channel count, and language. Added `AudioCodingModeFromCodec`, `LanguageCodeBytes`, and `NumChannelsField` helpers to `internal/dvd/ifo` with unit tests.
- **Drag crash fix (revised)** — Dragging a video file into the Author module no longer hard-crashes back to the login screen. Root cause was `handleDrop` triggering a full 7-tab `showAuthorView()` rebuild on the main thread during DnD completion, which rendered a 720×480 GPU texture concurrent with the XWayland/GLFW DnD handshake. Fixed by adding an `authorClipsRefresh` callback (same pattern as `authorChaptersRefresh`) so drops only update the clip list widget — no view rebuild, no GPU upload during DnD. `addAuthorFiles` also runs off the main thread.
- **VTS_MAT byte layout** — Corrected all field byte offsets in `mat_serialize.go`/`vtsi.go` to match the packed `vtsi_mat_t` struct in libdvdread `ifo_types.h`. Previous code wrote table offsets at 0x1A2–0x1BE (inside `zero_17`) and audio attributes at 0x08D (inside `zero_12`). Now: table offsets at 0x0C8–0x0E4, video attrs at 0x200, audio count/attrs at 0x203/0x204, subpicture count/attrs at 0x255/0x256; `vtsi_last_byte` at 0x080; `vtstt_vobs` (title VOB start sector) at 0x0C4. Fixes dvdnav `zero_12`/`zero_17` violations and `ifoRead_VTS_PTT_SRPT failed`.
- **DVD menu VOB (M1/M2)** — `runNativeSpumux` now encodes the background PNG as an MPEG-2 still-video via ffmpeg and muxes it with SPU subpicture data into a proper DVD Program Stream VOB (`VIDEO_TS.VOB`). Falls back to video-only output if ffmpeg SPU mux fails.
- **PCI button table (M3)** — `PCIButton` struct added to `internal/dvd/vob/nav.go`. `WriteNAV_PCK` serializes up to 36 buttons with libdvdread-compatible bit-packed coordinate encoding (BTN_SL_NS at byte 94, BTN_NS at 95, entries at 98).
- **VMGM_VOBS_Sector (M4)** — `vmgMat.VMGM_VOBS_Sector` now set from the ISO layout pass so dvdnav can locate `VIDEO_TS.VOB` on disc.
- **Menu PGC sector patching (M5)** — `CellPlayback[0]` First/LastSector fields in each menu PGC updated with disc-absolute sector ranges derived from per-MPG file sizes and the `VIDEO_TS.VOB` disc start sector. Folder-mode equivalent added: sector offsets computed from individual MPG file sizes (cumulative), and `VMGM_VOBS_Sector` set to `VMG_Last_Sector+1` so libdvdread opens `VIDEO_TS.VOB` for the VMGM domain instead of treating it as absent.
- **VOB sector counter fix** — `WriteVideo` in `vob.go` no longer double-increments `currentSector`. The unconditional post-padding `currentSector++` has been restored to an `else` branch so `WritePadding` (which already increments) and the direct increment are mutually exclusive. This corrects `nv_pck_lbn` values in all NAV_PCKs for the menu VOB, fixing a VLC/dvdnav crash when navigating a generated DVD folder.
- **ExtrasMpg wiring (M6)** — `menuSet.ExtrasMpg` concatenated into `VIDEO_TS.VOB`; extras PGC built and included in the VMGM PGC table.
- **JumpVMGM_PGCN command (M7)** — `JumpVMGM_PGCNCommand(pgcN)` added to `internal/dvd/ifo/commands.go`; `ParseButtonCommand` now translates `"jump menu N;"` / `"jump menu pgc N;"` to the correct inter-menu PGC jump opcode (0x30, 0x06).

### Filter Integration (Complete)
- **Standalone filter jobs** — Filters module can now queue filter-only jobs without upscaling. "Add to Queue" button added to Filters module UI.
- **Filter job execution** — `executeFilterJob` supports color correction (brightness/contrast/saturation), enhancement (sharpness/denoise), transform (flip/rotate/grayscale), and stylistic filters (VHS/80s/Webcam effects) via FFmpeg.

### CI Fixes
- **Submodule sync** — Pushed missing commits to lt_mirror/fyne.git to fix CI failures.
- **filters_module.go** — Removed invalid `*videoSource` type assertion at line 110; `state.filtersFile` is `*videoSource` not `interface{}`, causing a Go 1.26 build failure in CI.
- **FFmpeg from source (Windows/Linux)** — Switched from BtbN pre-built packages to building FFmpeg, x264, and x265 from source. BtbN packages provide executables only (no `.a` static libraries) and bundle x264/x265 headers with `__declspec(dllimport)`, making static CGO linking impossible.
- **x265.pc C++ deps in Libs** — Moved `-lstdc++`/`-lsupc++`/`-lm` from `Libs.private` to `Libs` in the generated x265.pc. FFmpeg configure calls `pkg-config --libs` without `--static`, so `Libs.private` is never seen during the configure link test; the C++ runtime must be in the public `Libs` field.
- **Windows multiple-definition fix** — Stripped `-lsupc++` from `CGO_LDFLAGS` after `pkg-config --libs --static`. `libsupc++.a` (real static archive) and `libstdc++.dll.a` (DLL import stub) both define `std::type_info::operator==`; removing `-lsupc++` from the final Go binary link eliminates the duplicate symbol. `-lsupc++` remains in x265.pc for FFmpeg configure.
- **Windows disk space** — Added `-g0` to `CGO_CFLAGS` to suppress DWARF debug info in CGO intermediate `.s` files (FFmpeg headers otherwise generate multi-GB temp files in `C:\WINDOWS\TEMP`). Added MSYS2 package-cache/temp cleanup step before the Go build.
- **Linux cache invalidation** — Bumped Linux cache key `v2→v3` to force a rebuild with the corrected x265.pc after the `Libs.private` → `Libs` change.

## v0.1.1-dev38 (March 2026)

### Native DVD Engine
- **Native Go SPU encoder** — Added `internal/dvd/spu` with RLE encoding, display sequences, and `vob.WriteSPU` to generate zero-dependency DVD menus without spumux.
- **Menu VOB wiring** — Native SPU now wired into Author module menu generation pipeline.

### CI Fixes (Fyne API Changes)
- **Windows CI** — Fixed multiple compile errors from Fyne API changes: `desktop.KeyEvent`, `fyne.Color`, `VT_SUBTITLE_TYPE_TEXT`.
- **FFmpeg pinning** — Pinned Windows CI to BtbN n7.1 build to match Linux CI.
- **Build directives** — Replaced pkg-config CGO directives with explicit CFLAGS/LDFLAGS for cross-platform compatibility.

### Module Extraction
- **Subtitles module** — Full extraction to `internal/app/modules/subtitles/` with types, adapter, and view.
- **Inspect module** — Extracted to `internal/app/modules/inspect/view.go`.
- **Queue module** — Extracted to `internal/app/modules/queue/view.go`.
- **Upscale module** — Full extraction to `internal/app/modules/upscale/` with helpers, types, and view.

- **Upscale module** — Full module extracted to `internal/app/modules/upscale/` with helpers.go, types.go, and view.go

### GPU Rendering Pipeline
- **Fyne fork** — GPU texture optimization fork at `lt_mirror/fyne`
- **TexSubImage2D** — Efficient texture upload in GL painter
- **UpdatePixels wiring** — VideoPlayer SetFrame uses UpdatePixels for texture reuse
- **Debug logging** — Added TexSubImage2D vs TexImage2D logging in newGlRasterTexture

### Media Engine
- **Adaptive buffering** — GetBufferHealth, GetDecodeTimeTrend, AdjustBufferForPerformance
- **Error recovery** — DegradeToSoftware, ShouldDegrade for HW failure handling
- **Speed via keyboard** — `<` / `>` keys change playback speed (0.25x-2.0x)
- **Actual FPS seeking** — Frame seeking uses real video FPS instead of hardcoded 30

### Playback Enhancements
- **Phase 4 complete** — Buffering indicators, error recovery, performance tuning

## v0.1.1-dev35 (March 2026)

### Localization Updates (dev34 continuation)
- **Subtitles i18n** — 9 new strings added and wired up (SubtitlesOfflineHint, SubtitlesEmpty, SubtitlesExtractEmbed, SubtitlesOCROutput, SubtitlesOCRLanguage, SubtitlesShiftOffset, SubtitlesStart, SubtitlesEnd).
- **Audio/Filters/Inspect i18n wired** — All module views now use t.* i18n keys.
- **Status bar localization** — Added StatusNoActiveJobs to status bar.
- **Trim module compatibility** — Updated trim stub and native view to support OnAddToQueue callback and TrimClip struct.
- **Dialog title i18n** — 15+ new translation keys wired into main.go for Convert/Merge/Trim/Snippet modules (DialogInterlacingResults, DialogAutoCropDetection, DialogNoBlackBars, DialogQueueNotInit, DialogNoRunningJob, LabelSnippet, MergeStarted, TrimJobAdded).

### UI Fixes

- **Auto-check dropdown fix** — Fixed language switching issue in Settings Updates section.
- **Thumbnail contact sheet** — Increased header height (130→150px) and added filename truncation.
- **Inspect preview placeholder** — Replaced stuck "Loading preview" with proper idle player state and icons.
- **Preview frame capture** — Captured before interlace analysis to avoid UI stuck states.

### Trim Module
- **Trim job submission** — `submitTrimJob` creates queue.Job with proper Type, InputFile, OutputFile, and Config fields.

### Media Engine Overhaul
- **SplitView fixes** — Fixed divider color using exact VT Green #4CE870; implemented draggable divider with MouseMoved/Dragged handlers.
- **AudioPlayer improvements** — Added volume control (SetVolume/GetVolume), mute functionality, pause/resume control, proper error handling with logging.
- **Engine enhancements** — Added VideoInfo struct for metadata (Width, Height, FrameRate, Codec, Bitrate), Pause/Resume/TogglePause controls, volume/mute/speed controls, seeking with configurable accuracy (Frame/Keyframe/Accurate).
- **Queue improvements** — Added configurable max size limits to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- **Subtitle extraction** — New SubtitleExtractor for parsing subtitle streams from video files; supports SRT and ASS export formats.
- **Tests** — Added comprehensive test suite for media package (queue, clock, subtitle time formatting).
- **Player deprecation** — BackendMPV and BackendVLC marked as deprecated; factory now only supports FFplay and Native engines.

---

## v0.1.1-dev34 (March 2026)

### Localization Engine
- **Full i18n framework** — New `internal/i18n` package with a typed `Strings` struct as the single source of truth for every user-visible string. `T()` returns the active locale; listener callbacks let the entire UI refresh instantly on language change without a restart.
- **English (Canada) — en-CA** — 100% coverage; serves as fallback for all other locales.
- **French (Canada) — fr-CA** — Initial translation pass covering all core UI strings.
- **Inuktitut — iu** — Initial translation pass in Traditional Syllabics (ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ) with a Latin toggle in Settings.
- **Aboriginal Sans embedded** — Aboriginal Sans Regular/Bold embedded in the binary for correct UCAS/syllabics rendering with no external font install required.
- **Language selector in Settings** — Dropdown in General tab; change takes effect immediately across all visible UI including the active module.
- **Locale-aware module refresh** — Switching language now rebuilds whichever module is currently open, not just the main menu.

### Native Media Engine (Phase 1 — `native_media` build tag)
- **Core engine scaffolding** — CGO/FFmpeg engine in `internal/media/` providing a proper decode pipeline, gated behind `//go:build native_media` so standard builds are unaffected.
- **Demuxer + PacketQueue** — Thread-safe packet queue feeding a demuxer loop with audio stream discovery.
- **AudioPlayer** — Full audio decoding and resampling via libswresample + oto; integrated into the engine with playback state management.
- **MasterClock + A/V sync** — High-precision master clock drives frame timing; AudioPlayer syncs to it, eliminating the separate-process A/V drift described in issues #14–#16.
- **Frame stepping & Seek** — Frame-accurate step forward/back; Seek implementation with queue flushing for clean repositioning (issue #17 foundation).
- **SplitView widget** — Side-by-side video comparison widget; wired into Compare module under the `native_media` tag.

### Disc Authoring (continued)
- **Multitrack audio & subtitle support** — Author module now exposes per-track audio/subtitle stream selection from the source file with a mapping table in the authoring pipeline.
- **ScriptableTheme engine** — JSON-driven theme format allows defining DVD menu layouts, button positions, and colour palettes without recompiling. Default asset bundled.
- **Native Go menu renderer** — `internal/dvd/theme` renders menu backgrounds and overlays entirely in Go using `golang.org/x/image/font` — no ImageMagick dependency.
- **Archivist round-trip** — Rip → load → re-author pipeline validated; source disc metadata and track layout preserved through the cycle.
- **IFO reading (VTSI + VMGI)** — `internal/dvd/ifo` can now parse existing IFO files from real discs, enabling accurate re-authoring from ripped sources.
- **VOBU_ADMAP + VTS Attribute Table** — Sector-accurate seeking map and multi-VTS attribute table implemented for standards-compliant output.
- **Automated disc scan on drop** — Rip module detects and enumerates titles/tracks automatically when a folder, ISO, or VIDEO_TS path is dropped onto it.
- **Native UDF extraction** — `internal/dvd/udf` can extract files from existing UDF images.

### RIFE Frame Interpolation (Upscale module)
- **RIFE integration** (issue #23) — `rife-ncnn-vulkan` wired into the Upscale module with configurable frame multiplier and model selection. Estimated output FPS shown in real time. Falls back gracefully when the binary is not installed.

### Module Architecture Refactor
- **Seven modules extracted** — audio, filters, inspect, thumbnail, player, enhancement, and compare moved to `internal/app/modules/` with clean Options/callback boundaries, reducing root package size.
- **Module colour via Options** — All extracted modules receive their accent colour through `Options.ModuleColor` from the root; nav bar always matches the main menu tile colour.
- **Back button i18n + casing** — All modules now use `strings.ToUpper(t.ModuleXxx)` for back buttons — uppercase, locale-aware, and consistent across every module.

### UI & Bug Fixes
- **Inspect crash on no file** — Clicking Inspect with no video loaded caused an immediate nil-pointer crash; all 20 `OnGetXxx` callbacks now guard against nil source.
- **Hardware accel dropdown** — Only acceleration backends confirmed available by `ffmpeg -hwaccels` are shown. A saved value that is no longer available resets to auto.
- **Convert output prefill** — Output filename field no longer pre-populates with a stale name from a previous session when no file is loaded on startup.
- **Disc category consolidation** — Replaced three separate Author/Rip/Blu-ray show/hide toggles in Settings with a single "Show Disc category" toggle. Blu-ray tile retired from the main menu (functionality fully merged into Author and Rip).

### Branding
- **VT_LOGO-2** — New app icon and logo replacing the original placeholder design.

### Localization Updates (dev34 continuation)
- **Subtitles i18n** — 9 new strings added and wired up (SubtitlesOfflineHint, SubtitlesEmpty, SubtitlesExtractEmbed, SubtitlesOCROutput, SubtitlesOCRLanguage, SubtitlesShiftOffset, SubtitlesStart, SubtitlesEnd).
- **Audio/Filters/Inspect i18n wired** — All module views now use t.* i18n keys.
- **Status bar localization** — Added StatusNoActiveJobs to status bar.
- **Trim module compatibility** — Updated trim stub and native view to support OnAddToQueue callback and TrimClip struct.

### UI Fixes
- **Back button consistency** — Module name uppercase on all modules.
- **Auto-check dropdown fix** — Fixed language switching issue in Settings Updates section.
- **Thumbnail contact sheet** — Increased header height (130→150px) and added filename truncation.

## v0.1.1-dev33 (March 2026)

### Disc Authoring
- **Native DVD Engine Foundation** - Established the `internal/dvd` package structure for native authoring. This is the first step toward removing Linux-only dependencies (`dvdauthor`, `xorriso`) and enabling DVD/Blu-ray creation on Windows.
- **Phase 1: UDF Writer** - Started implementation of a native UDF 1.02 / ISO 9660 Bridge writer for standards-compliant disc images.

### Documentation
- **Wiki synchronization** - Migrated in-repo `docs/` to the Forgejo wiki at `git.leaktechnologies.dev`. Established a navigation sidebar and centralized documentation portal.

## v0.1.1-dev32 (March 2026)

### Settings
- **Dependency install buttons** - Each dependency in the Dependencies tab now has an actionable Install button. FFmpeg on Windows uses the app-local bootstrap.
- **Platform-filtered dependencies** - The Dependencies tab only lists tools relevant to the current platform.
- **WSL auto-install reverted** - Installing Ubuntu via WSL would consume 5-10 GB; removed from the lightweight app. dvdauthor/xorriso restricted to Linux/macOS builds.
- **Updates tab wired** - Check for Updates hits the Forgejo tags API (`/api/v1/repos/leak_technologies/VideoTools/tags?limit=1`) and compares against the running version; fixed owner mismatch in API URL.
- **Uninstall support** - Uninstall buttons shown per dependency where a package manager uninstall command is available.
- **Disc toggles hidden on Windows** - Author, Rip, Blu-ray visibility checkboxes hidden in Settings on Windows since those tools are unavailable on that platform.
- **cmd window popups suppressed** - All subprocess calls on Windows now use `HideWindowExec` / `HideWindowExecContext` to prevent console window flashes.

### Icons
- **SVG icon library** - ~150 Material Design SVG icons added to `assets/icons/`; ASCII placeholders replaced with real icon resources.
- **Icons embedded into binary** - Icons are baked into the binary at compile time via `//go:embed`; `GetIcon` reads from the embedded FS with no runtime disk access. Fixes blank icons on installed builds (issue #20).

### Convert Module
- **Player layout fixed** - Video pane used `NewVBox` which collapsed the canvas.Image to 0 px; rewritten with `NewBorder` so the video fills the centre and the transport bar is pinned to the bottom.
- **VSplit gap fixed** - Extra `NewVBox` wrapper around the video panel left dark empty space in the top half of the VSplit; removed so the video panel fills its full allocated area.
- **Player icons fixed** - ASCII fallback labels replaced with `widget.NewButtonWithIcon` using embedded SVG icons.
- **Active state fixed** - `s.active` was never set to `"convert"`, breaking drop handling and keyboard shortcuts inside the module.
- **Source state fixed** - `s.source` was not updated when loading a video via `loadVideo`; now set before rebuilding the view.
- **Convert UI cleanup (issue #5)** - Label alignments standardised, consistent separators added.

### Compare Module
- **Hide/show player toggle (issue #1)** - Toggle button added to hide/show both video players, giving more vertical space for comparison.

### Main Menu / Navigation
- **Author and Rip hidden on Windows** - Disc modules hidden from the main menu on Windows until cross-platform disc authoring is implemented.
- **Mouse back button fixed** - Side mouse buttons now navigate correctly; back button (button 4) returns to main menu.
- **Keyboard shortcuts simplified** - Ctrl+Enter is the universal confirm action on Linux/Windows.
- **Drag-to-scroll fixed (issue #19)** - `container.Scroll` was silently consuming desktop drag events via a mobile-only guard. Replaced with a custom `scrollClip` widget that does not implement `fyne.Draggable`, so drag events reach `FastVScroll` and 1:1 content tracking works.
- **Pulsing drop indicator** - Video drop zone pulses when a draggable file hovers over the convert player area.
- **FastVScroll on all settings panels** - Upscale module settings and Convert metadata panel now use FastVScroll for consistent drag-to-scroll experience.

### Auto-Update
- **In-app updates** - Windows and Linux builds now support in-app auto-update. Check for Updates detects new releases; Install Update/Patches buttons download and apply updates automatically.

### UI
- **Main menu tile colour consistency** - Unavailable/missing-dependency module tiles now show a consistently dimmed module colour on first load.

## v0.1.1-dev31 (March 2026)

### UI
- **Module settings scrolling** - Scroll containers added to all non-Convert module settings panels; primary action buttons (Rip Now, Create Output, Apply Filters, Generate Now, Merge Now) pinned to always-visible footer action bar.
- **Window resize stability** - Window size is now preserved across module switches; layout-driven auto-resize no longer occurs.
- **Convert video pane** - Removed rigid minimum size from loaded-video stage so VSplit 50/50 offset holds correctly at all window sizes.
- **Click-and-drag scrolling** - Scroll panels now support click-and-drag in addition to mouse wheel, mirroring mobile/touch-screen behaviour. Drag up to scroll down, drag down to scroll up.
- **Convert module partial modularisation** - Added `ShowView`, `ConvertState`, and `ConvertCallbacks` entry point in `internal/app/modules/convert/view.go` with shim and type-converter helpers in `main.go`. Full `buildConvertView` extraction deferred pending appState decoupling.
- **Convert UI cleanup** - Layout and control organization pass to prepare Convert for external developer testing (in progress).
