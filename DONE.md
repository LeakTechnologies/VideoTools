## Version 0.1.0-dev22 (2026-01-01) - Bug Fixes & Documentation

### Bug Fixes
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Refactored Command Execution (Windows Console Fix Extended to Core Modules)**
  - Extended the refactoring of command execution to `audio_module.go`, `author_module.go`, and `platform.go`.
  - All direct calls to `exec.Command` and `exec.CommandContext` in these modules now use `utils.CreateCommand` and `utils.CreateCommandRaw`.
  - This completes the initial phase of centralizing command execution to further ensure that all external processes (including `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`) run without spawning console windows on Windows, improving overall application stability and user experience.

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Refactored Command Execution (Windows Console Fix Extended)**
  - Systematically replaced direct calls to `exec.Command` and `exec.CommandContext` across `main.go` and `internal/benchmark/benchmark.go` with `utils.CreateCommand` and `utils.CreateCommandRaw`.
  - This ensures all external processes (including `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`) now run without creating console windows on Windows, centralizing command creation logic and resolving disruptive pop-ups.

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Fixed Console Pop-ups on Windows**
  - Created a centralized utility function (`utils.CreateCommand`) that starts external processes without creating a console window on Windows.
  - Refactored the benchmark module and main application logic to use this new utility.
  - This resolves the issue where running benchmarks or other operations would cause disruptive `ffmpeg.exe` console windows to appear.

### Documentation
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Addressed Platform Gaps (Windows Guide)**
  - Created a new, comprehensive installation guide for native Windows (`docs/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md`).
  - Refactored the main `INSTALLATION.md` into a platform-agnostic hub that now links to the separate, detailed guides for Windows and Linux/WSL.
  - This provides a clear, user-friendly path for users on all major platforms.

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Aligned Documentation with Reality**
  - Audited and tagged all planned features in the documentation with `[PLANNED]`.
  - This provides a more honest representation of the project's capabilities.
  - Removed broken links from the documentation index.

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Created Project Status Page**
  - Created `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` to provide a single source of truth for project status.
  - Summarizes implemented, planned, and in-progress features.
  - Highlights critical known issues, like the player module bugs.
  - Linked from the main `README.md` to ensure users and developers have a clear, honest overview of the project's state.

This file tracks completed features, fixes, and milestones.

## Version 0.1.0-dev20+ (2025-12-28) - Queue UI Performance & Workflow Improvements

### Bug Fixes
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Player Module Investigation**
  - Investigated reported player crash
  - Discovered player is ALREADY fully internal and lightweight
  - Uses FFmpeg directly (no external VLC/MPV/FFplay dependencies)
  - Implementation: FFmpeg pipes raw frames + audio Ã¢â€ â€™ Oto library for output
  - Frame-accurate seeking and A/V sync built-in
  - Error handling: Falls back to video-only playback if audio fails
  - Player module re-enabled - follows VideoTools' core principles

### Workflow Enhancements
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Benchmark Result Caching**
  - Benchmark results now persist across app restarts
  - Opening Benchmark module shows cached results instead of auto-running
  - Clear timestamp display (e.g., "Showing cached results from December 28, 2025 at 2:45 PM")
  - "Run New Benchmark" button available when viewing cached results
  - Auto-runs only when no previous results exist or hardware has changed (GPU detection)
  - Saves to `~/.config/VideoTools/benchmark.json` with last 10 runs in history
  - No more redundant benchmarks every time you open the module

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Merge Module Output Path UX Improvement**
  - Split single output path field into separate folder and filename fields
  - "Output Folder" field with "Browse Folder" button for directory selection
  - "Output Filename" field for easy filename editing (e.g., "merged.mkv")
  - No more navigating through long paths to change filenames
  - Cleaner, more intuitive interface following standard file dialog patterns
  - Auto-population sets directory and filename independently

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Queue Priority System for Convert Now**
  - "Convert Now" during active conversions adds job to top of queue (after running job)
  - "Add to Queue" continues to add to end as expected
  - Implemented AddNext() method in queue package for priority insertion
  - User feedback message indicates queue position: "Added to top of queue!" vs "Conversion started!"
  - Better workflow when adding files during active batch conversions

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Auto-Cleanup for Failed Conversions**
  - Convert jobs now automatically delete incomplete/broken output files on failure
  - Success tracking ensures complete files are never removed
  - Prevents accumulation of partial files from crashed/cancelled conversions
  - Cleaner disk space management and error handling

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Queue List Jankiness Reduction**
  - Increased auto-refresh interval from 1000ms to 2000ms for smoother updates

### Performance Optimizations
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Queue View Button Responsiveness**
  - Fixed Windows-specific button lag after conversion completion
  - Eliminated redundant UI refreshes in queue button handlers (Pause, Resume, Cancel, Remove, Move Up/Down, etc.)
  - Queue onChange callback now handles all refreshes automatically - removed duplicate manual calls
  - Added stopQueueAutoRefresh() before navigation to prevent conflicting UI updates
  - Result: Instant button response on Windows (was 1-3 second lag)
  - Reported by: user report

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Main Menu Performance**
  - Fixed main menu lag when sidebar visible and queue active
  - Implemented 300ms throttling for main menu rebuilds (prevents excessive redraws)
  - Cached jobQueue.List() calls to eliminate multiple expensive copies (was 2-3 copies per refresh)
  - Smart conditional refresh: only rebuild sidebar when history actually changes
  - Result: 3-5x improvement in main menu responsiveness, especially on Windows
  - RAM usage confirmed: 220MB (lean and efficient for video processing app)

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Queue Auto-Refresh Optimization**
  - Reduced auto-refresh interval from 500ms to 1000ms (1 second)
  - Reduces UI thread pressure on Windows while maintaining smooth progress updates
  - Combined with 500ms manual throttle in refreshQueueView() for optimal balance

### User Experience Improvements

  - Hide benchmark indicator in Convert module when settings are already applied
  - Only show "Benchmark: Not Applied" status when action is needed
  - Removes clutter from UI when using benchmark settings
  - Cleaner interface for active conversions with benchmark recommendations

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Queue Position Labeling**
  - Fixed confusing priority display in queue view

  - Now displays "Queue Position: 1" for first job, "Queue Position: 2" for second, etc.
  - Applied to both Pending and Paused jobs

  - MKV: Allows almost everything (ultra-flexible)
  - WebM: Enforces VP8/VP9/AV1 video + Vorbis/Opus audio only
  - MOV: Apple-friendly codecs (H.264, H.265, ProRes, MJPEG)

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Automatic Fallback to Re-encoding**
  - WMV/ASF sources automatically re-encode (timestamp/codec issues)
  - FLV with legacy codecs (Sorenson/VP6) auto re-encode
  - Incompatible codec/container pairs auto re-encode to safe default (H.264)
  - User never gets broken files - system handles it transparently

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Auto-Fixable Format Detection**
  - AVI: Applies -fflags +genpts for timestamp regeneration
  - FLV (H.264): Applies timestamp fixes
  - MPEG-TS/M2TS/MTS: Extended analysis + timestamp fixes
  - VOB (DVD rips): Full timestamp regeneration
  - All apply -avoid_negative_ts make_zero automatically

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Enhanced FFmpeg Safety Flags**
  - All remux operations now include:
    - `-fflags +genpts` (regenerate timestamps)
    - `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero` (fix negative timestamps)
    - `-map 0` (preserve all streams)
    - `-map_chapters 0` (preserve chapters)
  - MPEG-TS sources get extended analysis parameters
  - Result: Robust, reliable remuxing with zero risk of corruption

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Codec Name Normalization**
  - Added normalizeCodecName() to handle codec name variations
  - Maps h264/avc/avc1/h.264/x264 Ã¢â€ â€™ h264
  - Maps h265/hevc/h.265/x265 Ã¢â€ â€™ h265
